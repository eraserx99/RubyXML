<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a collapsible garment and a method for using the same. More particularly, the invention relates to a swimsuit that can be folded into its belt or a pouch attached to the belt without the necessity of taking the garment off and a method for manufacturing such a swimsuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the &ldquo;back to nature&rdquo; movement and in enjoying life unencumbered by clothes. Most jurisdictions have regulations against public nudity and this acts as a restraint on those who would like to enjoy life in pretty much the state in which they were born. People will be people and those who would like to swim &ldquo;in the raw&rdquo;, so to speak, have two choices if they wish to act unfettered: (a) wear no clothing, or, (b) wear a swimsuit on the beach and take it all off when at a safe distance from any Peeping Toms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As noted above, option (a) is usually illegal and, in many instances, people are not disposed to so appear in public. There is also the problem of finding a deserted location at which to take off the swimsuit. Facilities for discrete donning and removal of clothing may not exist at beaches and swimming pools. Removing clothing also presents problems in cold and/or windy weather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Option (b), while aesthetically more appealing to the public at large, presents dangers to the swimmer. Taking the swimsuit off under water requires either bending down or stepping out of the swimsuit and can be dangerous and has the problem of collecting sand and grit inside the swimsuit. There is the additional problem of holding on to the garment once it has been taken off: if both hands are not devoted to the task, there is the risk of losing the swimsuit and the swimmer is back to the situation presented in option (a). Prior art swimsuits also present problems in putting the swimsuit back on. There is difficulty in identifying the proper holes into which legs must go, particularly in active surf. Once back on, any accumulated sand and grit can be very uncomfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,920 to Holland, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, teaches a swimsuit that includes a body and a belt, a portion of the body encircling a portion of the belt to form at least one pouch. The other end of the body has fastening devices that attach them to the belt opposite the pouch to form a conventional-looking swimsuit. Detaching the clips, folding up the body and inserting it into the pouch(es) gives a compact arrangement of a belt with a small pouch attached to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention of Holland is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art). As shown, the swimsuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adapted to encircle a human waist. The belt defines an inside and an outside. The belt is preferably made of a fabric with some ability to stretch so as to maintain a snug fit with the waist of the person wearing the garment. The swimsuit also includes a body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, one end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which defines a pair of pouches (storage compartments) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that enclose a portion of the belt. The sides of pouches are maintained in sliding contact with the portion of the belt that they encircle and are provided with openings purpose of which will be discussed below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pouches are separated by a seam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the middle, the seam coupling the body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An alternated embodiment of the invention has a single pouch extending all the way across the back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention of Holland, while being fully adapted for the function for which it was designed, was found to have some drawbacks. Drawbacks are purely aesthetic. When the swimsuit is fully folded into the pouch surrounding the belt may, it may have a bulky appearance. In addition, when the swimsuit is in the configuration for wear on the beach, it may be difficult to configure the top rear of the suit for a perfect fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a swimsuit that enables the law abiding swimmer to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Such a swimsuit should allow the swimmer to enter the water discretely clothed. Such a swimsuit should preferably be safe and easy to disengage from the human body. Such a swimsuit should remain attached to the human body without the use of hands. Such a swimsuit should be easy to put back on. In addition, it should preferably be aesthetically appealing in both the engaged and disengaged positions. The swimsuit should also be easy to manufacture. The present invention satisfies this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is a modification of a conventional swimsuit that has a pair of detachable fasteners. When the fasteners are decoupled, the portion of the swimsuit encircling human legs is &ldquo;opened up&rdquo; and may be rolled into a compact size that can be stowed inside a pouch on the swimsuit. Support for the swimsuit is provided by a loop that at least partially encircles a human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a method of using the novel swimsuit so as to appear covered up in the closed configuration of the swimsuit and to be able to open up the swimsuit while the swimsuit is supported by a loop around the human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a novel collapsible swimsuit by attaching a loop and a plurality of fastening devices to a prior art swimsuit that has been altered.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is best understood with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that illustrate the arrangement of the various parts of the swimsuit. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is shown. The swimsuit includes a loop <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> attached to the swimsuit to at least partially enclose a human waist: the exact manner in which it encircles the human waist is discussed below. The loop may be made of any suitable material but in a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> preferably comprises a decorative chain that is made of material resistant to corrosion by seawater. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop comprises a tubular member such as a cord or &ldquo;piping&rdquo;. Two fasteners <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are shown in the engaged position so that the swimsuit appears at first sight to be a conventional swimsuit with a decorative loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the swimsuit is shown in the disengaged configuration with the fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>now showing its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; disengaged into its components and fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disengaged into its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, another feature of the swimsuit becomes apparent: the rear of the swimsuit is seen to have an additional piece of fabric <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (with a seam <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) that defines a pouch between the member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the rear of the swimsuit. The pouch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has two openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the loop member is preferably inserted into the pouch (storage compartment). In one embodiment of the invention, the loop member may pass completely through the pouch and thus be capable of fully encircling the human waist. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop member may be fastened at two places (not shown) to the rear of the swimsuit and thus only partially encircle the human waist. Other configurations of the swimsuit may include two pouches as taught in Holland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As taught in Holland, the body of the swimsuit may be rolled up and inserted for storage into the pouch or storage compartment. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a method of making the swimsuit discussed above is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a conventional swimsuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By separating the swimsuit, e.g. by cutting, at locations indicated by <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> results. Manufacture of the swimsuit of the present invention then requires the addition of a piece of fabric <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to the swimsuit by a seam such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to define a storage compartment with ends <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> shown, the addition of fastening devices at or near the locations of the separation points <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the incorporation of the loop <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to give a result that would appear to be substantially the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The advantages of this method of making the swimsuit would be clear since this modification could be done to &ldquo;off the rack&rdquo; items that are widely available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the invention. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention </paragraph>

The garment is primarily intended for maintaining one or both of the user&apos;s arms close against the body to facilitate relaxation while in cramped or tight positions, such as in an airplane seat. However, the garment may also be used in a wide variety of applications wherein it is desired to support one or both of the user&apos;s arms in a releasably fixed position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a garment, and more specifically to a garment adapted for assisting a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various devices have been proposed for wear on a body to assist a person in maintaining his or her arms or legs in a desired position. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,137 to Bustance describes an athletic training device adapted to be worn by a boxer to help maintain the boxer&apos;s arms in the desired &ldquo;ready&rdquo; position during training exercises. The device in Bustance includes a vest element worn around the torso and a pair of sleeve elements worn around the bicep region of each arm. The vest and sleeve elements each include attachment means for releasably attaching the sleeves to the vest. This device improves the boxer&apos;s form by training him to hold his upper arms tightly against the sides of his torso while in the defensive position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,779 to Gerstung describes a form-keeping device for training gymnasts or spring-board divers to hold their legs and feet together during a gymnastic exercise or a dive. The device in Gerstung comprises a pair of straps adapted to be worn around the ankles and a pair of spacing elements configured to maintain the ankles at a fixed distance apart. Each of the ankle straps includes a portion having a loop or hook material for releasably attaching the two straps together during use to keep the ankles together during the desired routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,334 to Proffer describes a harness adapted for wear by the front rider of a tandem pair on a motorcycle. The harness is provided with a number of handholds for enabling the rear rider to hold on to the front rider. The handholds are positioned on the garment such that the rear rider can comfortably maintain his or her arms around the waist of the front rider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although various garment-type devices have been proposed for assisting persons to maintain their arms or legs in desired positions during physical activities, none of the proposed devices provides a means for assisting persons to releasably secure their hands to a desired location along their upper body. Such a device is very desirable for a number of reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, larger individuals are often quite uncomfortable during travel, such as by airplane, bus or train, because seats on these vehicles are typically not well-suited for larger body sizes and cannot be adjusted in width. As a result, the arms of larger individuals tend to extend over the armrest and thereby contact adjacent passengers. Worse yet, an individual&apos;s arm may extend into an aisle where it can be hit and injured by passersby or food carts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To avoid contacting other passengers and objects, some individuals have found it helpful to cross their arms and lay their hands flatly against their chest with their palms facing their torso. This position effectively narrows the individual&apos;s body width and thereby helps to prevent the problems just described. However, this position is difficult or impossible to maintain for extended periods due to the resulting muscle strain on the individual&apos;s shoulders and arms. The muscle strain and the associated discomfort can make it difficult or impossible for the passenger to relax or sleep during travel. Moreover, it has been found that prolonged muscle strain can lead to long-term health problems, such as, for example, tendinitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along his or her upper body is after an injury. Following an injury to an arm or shoulder, a sling is typically used to immobilize the arm. However, in many situations, a conventional sling may be uncomfortable, cumbersome or impractical. Furthermore, during the latter stages of the healing process, it may be desirable to use an injured arm for limited purposes; however, it can be very cumbersome to take off and put on a sling each time the person wishes to use his or her arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is during transportation of a victim via a stretcher or similar means. Many stretchers do not include a strap or belt for securing the victim onto the stretcher. Other times, a victim is unable or unwilling to accept being secured to a stretcher via a strap. When no strap is used, it is difficult to prevent the victim&apos;s arms from falling over the sides of the stretcher, particularly if the victim is particularly large or the stretcher is narrow. If one or both of the victim&apos;s arms fall over the sides of the stretcher it can seriously aggravate an existing injury or result in an additional injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is for minimizing the effects of certain neurological disorders. Some types of neurological disorders may be outwardly manifested by conditions such as body tremors or involuntary muscular movements. At times, such as in certain social situations or for safety concerns, it would be desirable to provide a device to help stabilize the person&apos;s hands and/or arms to prevent involuntary movements of the hands and/or arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, for at least these reasons, there remains a very real and substantial need for a new and improved garment that can be used to releasably secure a user&apos;s hands to the upper body in a desired position, such as in a folded configuration. Such a garment would be beneficial for the reasons described above and would be particularly useful for allowing larger individuals to travel in greater comfort. To be practical, it is desirable that such a garment be comfortable to wear. It is also desirable that such a garment has a minimum number of parts and utilizes simple attachment means for convenience and ease of use. It is also desirable that such a garment is constructed of durable materials that can be washed and reused. Finally, it is desirable that such a garment be inexpensive to manufacture, aesthetically appealing, and versatile enough for a wide range of applications. The present invention addresses these needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A primary object of the present invention is to provide a garment that enables a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the garment comprises an upper portion, such as a vest or shirt, adapted for wear on the user&apos;s torso region. The upper portion has at least a region formed with a first attachment means. The garment also comprises a hand portion, such as a glove or strap, adapted for wear along at least one of the user&apos;s hands. The hand portion has a region formed with a second attachment means that is releasably engageable to the first attachment means for attaching the user&apos;s hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a variety of attachment means can be used with the present invention including, but not limited to, loop and hook materials, buttons, hooks, snaps and clasps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment is in the form of a strap that can be worn around the user&apos;s neck. The first attachment means is preferably located along the ends of the strap. The strap may include a padded region along the portion of the strap that passes along the back of the user&apos;s neck. The padded region increases the user&apos;s comfort and can be used to support the user&apos;s head during rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap or a chest strap having a section with the first attachment means disposed along the outer surface of the strap. The hand portion, such as a glove, is releasably engageable to the strap for immobilizing one or both hands or arms.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Larger individuals are often uncomfortable while seated on vehicles such as airplanes, buses or trains because their arms tend to extend over the armrests and contact adjacent passengers or passersby. As a result, many individuals have found it helpful to place their arms in a folded position across their chest. This position effectively narrows their body width and helps to avoid contact with others. Unfortunately, however, this position can be very difficult to maintain, particularly during longer trips. Therefore, a need exists for a garment system that provides users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms at selectable locations along their upper body. Such a device would help prevent muscle strain and thereby significantly increase the user&apos;s comfort during travel. Such a device would also be useful in a wide variety of other applications, such as for maintaining a user&apos;s hands or arms in a fixed position during rehabilitation after an injury or to help control body tremors resulting from neurological disorders. To be practical, the garment system must be reliable, convenient and easy to transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To address these needs, the present invention provides a new and improved garment adapted for providing users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms along their upper body. Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for purposes of illustration, a preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including, generally, an upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a pair of hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is worn over the torso and can take a variety of different forms, such as, for example, a shirt, a vest or a sweater. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material that provides a first attachment means, such as, for example, a loop material. Alternatively, patches of material can be sewn or otherwise attached to the upper portion of the garment to provide first attachment means in specific locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a pair of gloves with open fingers for comfort and convenience. However, it will be appreciated that the hand portions may take a variety of different forms. Furthermore, the hand portions may be worn on the wrists or forearms and therefore the term &ldquo;hand portions&rdquo; should not be construed as limited to articles adapted for wear only on the hands. The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include at least a region of material, such as, for example, a hook material, that provides a second attachment means. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm. The second attachment means releasably adheres to the first attachment means for providing the user with the ability to affix at least one hand to his or her upper body at a selectable location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> during use wherein the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a comfortable and convenient means for maintaining the user&apos;s hands in a fixed position along his or her upper body. As discussed above, this garment is particularly well suited for larger people while traveling on vehicles, such as on airplanes, buses, or trains, wherein the seats are often too narrow for their body size. By enabling the user to easily maintain his or her arms in a desired position along his or her upper body, the user&apos;s arms are prevented from contacting adjacent passengers or passersby and therefore the user can relax or sleep in comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the user places his or her palms against his or her upper body in the desired location, the region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm of each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> removably adheres to the material on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can relax his or her shoulders and arms and permit the garment to bear the load of the dead weight of the arms. As a result, muscle strain and tendonitis in the arms and shoulders can be avoided. The first and second attachment means are chosen to be sufficiently strong such that the dead weight of the arms will not cause the first and second attachment means to separate disadvantageously. As discussed below, this garment can take many different forms; however, each of the forms is manufactured to be capable of providing the user with a reliable means to support of one or both arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Additional components may be attached to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be provided for enhanced head and neck support. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with at least a region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of second attachment means, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for adhering to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the front shoulder region. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can include an additional region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of second attachment means for attachment along the back of the user&apos;s collar on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The neck pad may take a variety of forms, such as, for example, a stuffed pillow or an inflatable tube. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> during use. In addition, similar pads may be attached to other areas of the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment, such as, for example, along the forearms, elbows or on a shoulder, for enhancing the user&apos;s comfort. Furthermore, pockets (not shown) may be attached to the upper portion at selectable locations for a wide variety of different purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a garment according to the present invention wherein the upper portion comprises a crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably attaches to itself at attachment location <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to form a loop. The loop of the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed over the head and is provided with first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A significant feature of this embodiment is the ability to take the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on and off quickly and easily, as compared with a sweater or vest. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may include a padded neck region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of a garment according the to present invention wherein the upper portion is provided in the form of a non-crossing strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is placed around the back of the neck and lays over the front region of the shoulders. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also includes a padded neck region <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> illustrate alternative embodiments of hand portions comprising straps that are worn around the hands or wrists. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising palm straps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that wrap around the palm region of the hand. Each palm strap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising wrist straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each wrist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates yet another embodiment of the garment that is particularly well suited for immobilizing a victim&apos;s arm, such as, during rehabilitation after an injury. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adapted for wear across one shoulder. A region of first attachment means is provided at least along a region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the exterior of the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.

As discussed above, the upper portion may be manufactured in a variety of different forms including, but not limited to, a shirt, sweater, vest or strap. Furthermore, the upper portion may be manufactured to be very durable for long-term use or may be manufactured to be disposable, such as for onetime use by passengers on an airplane, train or bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The entire upper portion may be made of a loop material fabric or, alternatively, the fabric may be provided along only a limited desired region. In addition, the upper portion may have loop material along one or both sides (i.e., it may be single or double-sided). An upper portion manufactured from a double-sided loop material may be reversible and may also provide the ability to attach articles, such as pockets, along both the exterior and interior of the upper portion. The upper portion may also include a zipper in the front, preferably made of a plastic material for increased comfort and for avoiding detection by metal detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The fabric used in the manufacture of the upper portion is preferably breathable, lightweight, washable, flame-retardant, waterproof and has a soft surface for comfort against the skin. In one preferred embodiment, the fabric comprises a laminated loop material such as VELTEX&reg; manufactured by VELCRO USA, Inc. VELTEX&reg; provides a relatively soft and even surface that is aesthetically pleasing and can be manufactured into a functional garment that can be worn for warmth or style in nearly any environment. In another preferred embodiment, the loop material comprises a medical grade laminate that provides increased attachment strength and improved duty cycles for durability over long periods. Medical grade laminates generally comprise a soft breathable foam substrate with knitted nylon loop provided along one or both surfaces thereof. VELCRO USA, Inc. provides a wide variety of medical grade laminates that are suitable for use with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The hand portions of the garment are preferably manufactured to include a region of hook material, at least along the palm or inner wrist, for providing a second attachment means for attachment with the first attachment means. As discussed above, the hand portions may be manufactured for wear along the hands, wrists or forearms. The gloves may be open-fingered for increased comfort and functionality, similar to weight lifting gloves (e.g., as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Although the first and second attachment means of the preferred embodiments are described above with respect to hook and loop materials, it will be appreciated that alternative first and second attachment means may also be used. For example, the invention may be used with attachment devices such as buttons, hooks, snaps and clasps or any other device wherein the first attachment means may be releasably attached to a second attachment means in a quick and easy manner. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that, when hook and loop materials are used, the hooks may be provided on the upper portion while the loops are provided on the hand portions, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the garment system of the present invention is very convenient to use. Due to the minimal number of components and ease of use, the garment may be easily transported or stored in small area. In addition, the garment system of the present invention is very versatile and can be used in a broad range of applications at home or during travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In certain applications, the garment system is usable by two or more persons. For example, in one application, the upper portion (e.g., a vest) is worn by a motorcycle rider while the hand portion (e.g., gloves) is worn by a passenger. In this application, the garment provides a safety mechanism by helping to ensure that the passenger&apos;s hands are firmly secured to the rider&apos;s upper body. In other applications, the upper portion and hand portions may be used for instructional purposes, such as hand placement during dancing, or for a wide variety of other instructional or recreational purposes, such as games and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will also be appreciated that various additional modifications can also be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to exercise clothing, and more particularly to a vest with which one or more weights may be associated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A variety of fitness and training techniques are known. A common training technique is the moving of a mass, such as a metal weight. In one form of training, one or more weights are either directly moved or mounted to a support which is moved. This type of training is known as &ldquo;free weight&rdquo; training. In another form of weight training, weights are associated with a mechanical apparatus. For example, a weight may be located at one end of a cable. The cable may pass over one or more pulleys to a handle or grip. The user grips the handle and moves the cable, and thus the weight attached to the cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem with both of these forms of weight training is that the apparatus or free weights are not suited to being transported. The user travels to the location of the weights or apparatus, exercises, and then leaves the location of the weights or apparatus. There are numerous drawbacks to this arrangement. Among these drawbacks are that the user can not train unless the user is at the location of the weights or apparatus. Another problem is that the user can not generally engage in other activities while training. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As one attempt to overcome these problems, ankle and wrist weights have been developed. These devices generally comprise a flexible annular member filled with metal shot. The weighted device may be placed around the ankle or wrist. So worn, the user may walk, run or engage in other activities which are generally not permitted when using free weights or weight apparatus. On the other hand, these devices still have significant drawbacks. One drawback is that all of the weight is concentrated at the angle or wrist, centralizing the load. This is uncomfortable and does not always yield the best training results. In addition, because the devices are attached to a generally circular area of the body, its is difficult to constrain the device while the user is moving. For example, while running these devices may move up and down with respect to the body, counteracting the desired training effect and interfering with the user&apos;s balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other attempts at solving these problems have been unsuccessful as well. General problems associated with wearable weight systems are numerous. A significant problem is that such devices are not fully constrained and may move relative to the body. In general, training with these devices is most effective when the body is in motion, thus requiring movement of the associated weight device. However, because the device is not fully constrained, the heightened movement of the user during exercise generally results in heightened relative movement of the device. Again, this counteracts the desired training effect and can cause instability and discomfort to a user. In addition, it is desirable to be able to readily be able to change the amount of weight which is associated with the device and the location of the device. Current devices do not satisfactorily address these needs. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, this vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is particularly configured to be worn by a female, while the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are particularly designed to be worn by a male. In general, this embodiment vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is identical to the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described above and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, except that the arrangement of panels comprising a shell <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> differs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a first panel P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a shoulder portion of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Referring only to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, panels P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constitute the rear portion of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A panel P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is located at the lower edge of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this panel P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> preferably generally encircles the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the front of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a six panels P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The panels defining opposing first and second sides, each having an edge which is connectable to the other with a zipper or other fastening member(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the panels P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are constructed of a material having a different color that the material forming the other panels. In this configuration, the panels create a visually appealing color patten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, means may be provided for selectively coupling the first and second sides of the front of the shell of the vest of the invention other than or in addition to the zipper, flap and straps. For example, buttons or snaps may be utilized, as may mating hook and loop fastening material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Use of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that use of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> is essentially the same. A user selects the particular weight or weights, if any, which they wish to associate with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Of course, a user may desire to not associate any weights with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and simply wear the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as configured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the weights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which are utilized with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a configuration as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As illustrated, these weights are constructed from metal, such as cast iron or stainless steel. The weights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are thin and generally rectangular in shape. As described in more detail below, this particular weight configuration has several advantages. Of course, a user may utilize weights having a variety of configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a user utilizes weights having a mass of approximately 1 pound for the compartments of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Weights having other masses may be used, such as 0.5 pounds or 2 pounds. Weights having a greater or lesser mass may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The user places a weight in each of the pockets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as desired. In general, the user opens the flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> associated with each pocket to expose the fourth side or opening to each pocket or the compartments thereof. The user then places the desired weight in the pocket. In the preferred embodiment where each pocket includes a plurality of individual weight compartments, the user may place a weight in any or all of the compartments, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment where weights having a mass of 1 pound are used and the pockets have 40 compartments, the maximum mass of the weights which may be associated with the vest comprises 40 pounds. The total mass which may be associated with the vest may vary dependent upon the mass of the weights used, the number of weights used, and the number of compartments provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Next, the user closes the flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> associated with each pocket. The flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is secured into a closed position, such as by engaging the provided hook and loop fastening material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The user then places the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on their body. The user ensures that the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is unzipped and the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are disconnected, allowing movement of the first side <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> relative to the second side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The user extends their arms through the first and second arm openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and aligns their neck with the neck opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The user opens the sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sufficient to extend them around the front of their torso. The user then zips the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, securing the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to one another. In addition, the user optionally secures the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. To do so, the user pulls the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> across the first side <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and secures it with the hook and loop fastening material or other means for connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user may also connect opposing portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the first strap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the opposing portions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the second strap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to one another. If necessary, the user may shorten or lengthen the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to obtain a snug and secure fit of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their body. It will be appreciated that by changing the length of the straps, the user may change the size of the perimeter of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at its bottom edge. By reducing the size of the perimeter, the user tightens the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> With the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so positioned on their body, a user may engage in any of a variety of activities. These activities may include specific exercises, such as running, lunges, squats, push-ups, sit-ups and other activities. The user may also engage in activities which are not specifically intended to be exercises, such as household chores, walking, shopping and the like. Regardless, the additional weight which is borne by the user is useful in working the user&apos;s various muscles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> One or more of the steps of use may occur in an order other than described above. For example, a user may place the vest on their body, and then place one or more weights in the vest. In addition, a user may remove weights from the vest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention has numerous advantages and overcomes significant problems associated with prior art exercise apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a vest is provided which is capable of accepting weights, where the weights are secured. First, the weights are located in individual pockets or compartments, preventing the weights from shifting during movement of the wearer or from falling from the vest. In addition, the weights are located in pockets which are located at the interior of the shell of the vest. When the vest is worn, the weights are tightly held between the wearer&apos;s body and the shell of the vest, securely holding the weights in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The construction of the vest contributes to the high degree to which the weights are secured. As indicated above, a significant problem with prior devices is that the weights may move relative to a user. This problem is exacerbated when the user&apos;s movements are accentuated, such as when the user exercises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a vest is provided which secures the weights so that the weights do not move relative to the user&apos;s body. Because the weights move with, and not relative to the user&apos;s body, problems such as imbalance, discomfort and the like are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As indicated, in a preferred embodiment, the shell is constructed of multiple panels. These panels can be customized in size and shape, so that the assembled vest is adapted to fit a particular wearer perfectly. As noted, the vest of the invention may be specially configured to be worn by a female (ex. FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) or a male (ex. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Any particular vest configuration may be provided. For example, two different users may have a shoulder area having the same size and shape, but have a different mid-torso area. In that event, when considering the embodiment vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the panels P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be the same for each vest, but the panels P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be larger in the case of one of the vests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The material from which the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed also contributes to the securing of the weights. As described, in a preferred embodiment, the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed from a durable but flexible/elastic material. Preferably, the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sized so that it fits the user snugly. In one embodiment, when the user zips the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are pulled towards one another, tightly encircling the user. The elasticity of the vest material permits sufficient stretching of the material that any gap between the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> before the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is zipped is closed when the zipper is zipped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> So that the weights associated with the pockets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> along the lower edge of the vest are secured, the user preferably tightens the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> permit the wearer to specifically tighten the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against their body in the location of these weights, compressing the weights between the vest and their body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is that the vest permits location of the weights in anatomically advantageous positions. First, one or more weights may be located near the bottom edge of the vest, corresponding to the user&apos;s waist. In this location, the weights are secured about the structurally sound hip area of the body. This area of the body is adapted to carry heavy loads, and is centrally located such that the extra weight is unlikely to interfere with balance. Second, weights may be located in an area corresponding to the front and rear shoulder, adjacent each arm. Again, the body is adapted to support loads in the shoulder area. In addition, the mind and body are already design to address balance (or imbalance) arising from movement of the arms. The weights are similarly located and thus do not generally effect the balance or other movements of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Location of the weights in different areas is also advantageous since such permits the weights to be useful in a greater variety of situations. For example, any weights associated with the vest are useful in training when running, jumping or the like. When doing sit-ups, however, the weights located at the lower edge of the vest are near the pivot point of the body, and have less effect than do weights located in the pockets near the arm openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The construction of the vest is such that it is extremely comfortable. Another problem with prior devices is that when applied to the body, they are often not comfortable. This leads to a user stopping the use of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in one embodiment, the comfort of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> arises from its multi-panel construction. This construction permits the vest to be particularly sized and shaped to fit the body. In addition, the shell of the vest comprises a somewhat elastic material, allowing the shell to conform to the shape of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also comprises a separate shell and lining. As will be appreciated, during exercise if an article of clothing tightly adheres to the body but moves even slightly relative thereto, then a rubbing effect results. The user may get blisters or scrapes as a result of this relative movement. In accordance with the invention, the lining acts as a buffer between the more rigid structural shell and the user&apos;s body. Some movement of this shell is permitted relative to the lining, which protects the underlying body of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The lining also lends directly to the comfort of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As indicated, the shell of the vest is preferably constructed of a durable material such as a cotton/nylon, rayon or poly blend. While this type of material is advantageous because of its structural abilities, the material does not breathe well. The lining is a mesh material which includes perforations which permit air to flow there through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the above described arrangements of apparatus and the method therefrom are merely illustrative of applications of the principles of this invention and many other embodiments and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Application of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a headgear structure with a transformable peak, and particularly relates to a headgear structure which, in combination with a peak secured to the front edge of the crown, can be bent anytime and anywhere to form the peak style of varying bending arcs, thus enabling the wearers to match their clothing and enhance their personal style; the peaked headgear can bear different visual effects by simply changing the style of the peak, so as to be suitable to all kinds of peaked headgear structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> People adore outdoor entertainment/sports which, however, can easily cause severe sun burn. For as long as the head-wearable caps have been designed and extensively used, the styling and aesthetic effects of the caps have been of concern to the consumers. Varying caps are worn depending on different timing, occasion and clothing, rendering the derivation of various types of peaked headgear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Taking the essential structure and style of a sports cap shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for example, the cap, basically a leisure cap (or baseball cap), has six gores seamed to form a crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> secured to the front edge of the crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to satisfy sun block requirements. The structure of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes a plastic board in-between the upper and lower fabric layers, and a seam <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed on the brim of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The outer appearance of the conventional cap cannot be greatly varied based on the reasons that the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is usually made of rigid plastic in the form of a flat or fixed first quarter moon shape, thus preventing any method of styling. Given the single style and the unadjustable peak shape, the cap cannot provide the feature of free adjustment and shaping. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The primary object of the present invention is to provide a headgear structure with a transformable peak, the structure and design of the peak permit free bending to alter the outline thereof, rendering variation in the overall appearance of the cap and subsequently increasing its aesthetic and novelty effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a headgear structure with a transformable peak which includes flexible elements provided on the seam portion between the top peak fabric and the under peak fabric being outer cover layers for peak board. After said flexible elements are bent and shaped, said peak board can be set to an arc shape along with the flexible elements, thus increasing the effect of varying the outer appearance of the peaked headgear. Besides, while the flexible elements can be made of metal or non-metal having the feature of being flexed and adjusted to a set shape, the peak board is in the form of a relatively soft laminate, so that after the flexible elements of the peak are bent, the rigid stress of the flexible elements is greater than the resilience of the peak board, thereby the peak board can be set to an arc shape along with the flexible elements, and the outer appearance of the peaked headgear can be varied to satisfy different wearers&apos; fondness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an outer appearance of a cap of prior art. As previously described, the peak thereof cannot be freely adjusted, and thus decreases the value of its utility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference>A, a cap according to an embodiment of the invention is formed of a cap crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a seam, and the structure of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided inside thereof; the upper and lower sides of the peak board are sheathed by a known fabric layer. Flexible metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are invisibly provided inside of the seam in the front of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). In this way, the peak will become integrated with the cap crown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be bent to certain angles can be common metal, such as copper, iron, aluminum, etc., whereas the sheathing fabric layer is water-proof. The cords may also be made of flexible non-metal, so as to avoid rust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A, while comparing the embodiment of the invention with the cap shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the flexible metal cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a metal cord <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sheathed by a water-proof plastic sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that the sheathing fabric layer of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must not necessarily be water-proof and no rust would occur to the metal cords <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sheathed inside thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, as the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with the flexible elements, the present invention can permit the wearers to freely bend the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the flexible metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided on the front edge of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to change their arc shapes, thus styling the intended shape of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, as the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided on the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the form of a soft laminate, so long as the metal or non-metal cords are flexed, the peak can greatly change its shape via forcible bending as shown, and therefore the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes a fashionable style as illustrated, which is liked by youth. That is one of the benefits of the invention for making the cap style younger and more attractive in appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, the appended drawings only show the flexible elements invisibly provided inside of the peak, like the design concept of the invention, if the flexible elements are provided on the seams in-between the top and under peaks of the cap (as shown in part B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). It can also obtain the feature of flexing the peak to different shapes and thus is included in the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the invention can improve the dull style of the prior art, by providing the flexible elements in the peak to enable a change of the style thereof and, in turn, the style of the cap. Therefore, the effect of varying the cap style with matching decorations on the cap can be reached. The utility of the peak according to the invention is greatly increased, since it can suit all kinds of peaked headgear, and with the doubtless value, the inventor of the invention claims the exposure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a collapsible garment and a method for using the same. More particularly, the invention relates to a swimsuit that can be folded into its belt or a pouch attached to the belt without the necessity of taking the garment off and a method for manufacturing such a swimsuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the &ldquo;back to nature&rdquo; movement and in enjoying life unencumbered by clothes. Most jurisdictions have regulations against public nudity and this acts as a restraint on those who would like to enjoy life in pretty much the state in which they were born. People will be people and those who would like to swim &ldquo;in the raw&rdquo;, so to speak, have two choices if they wish to act unfettered: (a) wear no clothing, or, (b) wear a swimsuit on the beach and take it all off when at a safe distance from any Peeping Toms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As noted above, option (a) is usually illegal and, in many instances, people are not disposed to so appear in public. There is also the problem of finding a deserted location at which to take off the swimsuit. Facilities for discrete donning and removal of clothing may not exist at beaches and swimming pools. Removing clothing also presents problems in cold and/or windy weather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Option (b), while aesthetically more appealing to the public at large, presents dangers to the swimmer. Taking the swimsuit off under water requires either bending down or stepping out of the swimsuit and can be dangerous and has the problem of collecting sand and grit inside the swimsuit. There is the additional problem of holding on to the garment once it has been taken off: if both hands are not devoted to the task, there is the risk of losing the swimsuit and the swimmer is back to the situation presented in option (a). Prior art swimsuits also present problems in putting the swimsuit back on. There is difficulty in identifying the proper holes into which legs must go, particularly in active surf. Once back on, any accumulated sand and grit can be very uncomfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,920 to Holland, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, teaches a swimsuit that includes a body and a belt, a portion of the body encircling a portion of the belt to form at least one pouch. The other end of the body has fastening devices that attach them to the belt opposite the pouch to form a conventional-looking swimsuit. Detaching the clips, folding up the body and inserting it into the pouch(es) gives a compact arrangement of a belt with a small pouch attached to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention of Holland is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art). As shown, the swimsuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adapted to encircle a human waist. The belt defines an inside and an outside. The belt is preferably made of a fabric with some ability to stretch so as to maintain a snug fit with the waist of the person wearing the garment. The swimsuit also includes a body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, one end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which defines a pair of pouches (storage compartments) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that enclose a portion of the belt. The sides of pouches are maintained in sliding contact with the portion of the belt that they encircle and are provided with openings purpose of which will be discussed below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pouches are separated by a seam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the middle, the seam coupling the body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An alternated embodiment of the invention has a single pouch extending all the way across the back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention of Holland, while being fully adapted for the function for which it was designed, was found to have some drawbacks. Drawbacks are purely aesthetic. When the swimsuit is fully folded into the pouch surrounding the belt may, it may have a bulky appearance. In addition, when the swimsuit is in the configuration for wear on the beach, it may be difficult to configure the top rear of the suit for a perfect fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a swimsuit that enables the law abiding swimmer to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Such a swimsuit should allow the swimmer to enter the water discretely clothed. Such a swimsuit should preferably be safe and easy to disengage from the human body. Such a swimsuit should remain attached to the human body without the use of hands. Such a swimsuit should be easy to put back on. In addition, it should preferably be aesthetically appealing in both the engaged and disengaged positions. The swimsuit should also be easy to manufacture. The present invention satisfies this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is a modification of a conventional swimsuit that has a pair of detachable fasteners. When the fasteners are decoupled, the portion of the swimsuit encircling human legs is &ldquo;opened up&rdquo; and may be rolled into a compact size that can be stowed inside a pouch on the swimsuit. Support for the swimsuit is provided by a loop that at least partially encircles a human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a method of using the novel swimsuit so as to appear covered up in the closed configuration of the swimsuit and to be able to open up the swimsuit while the swimsuit is supported by a loop around the human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a novel collapsible swimsuit by attaching a loop and a plurality of fastening devices to a prior art swimsuit that has been altered.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is best understood with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that illustrate the arrangement of the various parts of the swimsuit. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is shown. The swimsuit includes a loop <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> attached to the swimsuit to at least partially enclose a human waist: the exact manner in which it encircles the human waist is discussed below. The loop may be made of any suitable material but in a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> preferably comprises a decorative chain that is made of material resistant to corrosion by seawater. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop comprises a tubular member such as a cord or &ldquo;piping&rdquo;. Two fasteners <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are shown in the engaged position so that the swimsuit appears at first sight to be a conventional swimsuit with a decorative loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the swimsuit is shown in the disengaged configuration with the fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>now showing its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; disengaged into its components and fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disengaged into its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, another feature of the swimsuit becomes apparent: the rear of the swimsuit is seen to have an additional piece of fabric <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (with a seam <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) that defines a pouch between the member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the rear of the swimsuit. The pouch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has two openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the loop member is preferably inserted into the pouch (storage compartment). In one embodiment of the invention, the loop member may pass completely through the pouch and thus be capable of fully encircling the human waist. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop member may be fastened at two places (not shown) to the rear of the swimsuit and thus only partially encircle the human waist. Other configurations of the swimsuit may include two pouches as taught in Holland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As taught in Holland, the body of the swimsuit may be rolled up and inserted for storage into the pouch or storage compartment. As discussed in Holland, this is accomplished by rolling up the portion of the swimsuit disengaged from the portion of the swimsuit proximate to the loop and inserting the rolled up portion into the pouch. This is shown in after rolling up and storing in the pouch in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Details of the method of rolling up and storing are discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a method of making the swimsuit discussed above is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a conventional swimsuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By separating the swimsuit, e.g. by cutting, at locations indicated by <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> results. Manufacture of the swimsuit of the present invention then requires the addition of a piece of fabric <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to the swimsuit by a seam such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to define a storage compartment with ends <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> shown, the addition of fastening devices at or near the locations of the separation points <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the incorporation of the loop <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to give a result that would appear to be substantially the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The advantages of this method of making the swimsuit would be clear since this modification could be done to &ldquo;off the rack&rdquo; items that are widely available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The method in which the swimsuit is stored within itself is shown using the teachings of Holland as an example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the invention of Holland when the fasteners are disengaged and the body is rolled up tightly to abut the pouches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> encircling the belt <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The body in the rolled up position is depicted by <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>&prime;. Also shown are the openings <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> in the pouches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Because the pouches of Holland are made of the same material as the body and are flexible, the rolled up body can be inserted into the openings and at the same time, the edges of the opening <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> folded back to the position <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the ends of the opening have been folded back from both sides. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the clips are disengaged, the body rolled up, and the ends of the opening folded back, the entire garment collapses to a compact shape defined by the belt and the small enclosure around it. The same method is used in the present invention for rolling up and storing the swimsuit within itself using the openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an illustration of an alternate embodiment of a swimsuit in what is commonly known as a &ldquo;thong&rdquo; swimsuit. Shown is a swimsuit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> with a &ldquo;thong&rdquo; portion <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> extending to the back of the swimsuit, the front of the swimsuit having a width greater than the width of the thong at the back of the swimsuit. The swimsuit is provided with a pouch <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> defined by the seam <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of a piece of fabric attached to the body of the swimsuit. To simplify the illustration, the openings of the pouch are not shown. A chain <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> (or piping or other tubular member) defines a loop that can encircle the human waist. Alternatively, element <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may be an integral part of the body of the swimsuit. As with the embodiment discussed above, the chain or tubular member may circle the human waist partially or entirely. The end of the thong is provided with a fastener <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> for attaching to the chain <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. One important difference between this embodiment of the invention and the one discussed above (and in Holland) is that the pouch is now in the front rather than in the back. The method of folding and stowing remain the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the invention. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a helmet that is particularly well suited for cold-weather use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A prior art helmet comprises a head portion that protects the head of a wearer, as a conventional helmet; a jaw shield, which is integrated with and forms a projection with the head portion and protects the lower part of the face of the wearer, more particularly the jaw; and an eye shield, which is situated between an upper front section of the head portion and an upper section of the jaw shield to protect the face of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to its structure, the helmet has a small interior chamber. This interior chamber is usually insulated from the atmosphere to protect the wearer from cold air. At a certain temperature, water vapor in the humid air exhaled by the wearer will create condensation. Because the temperature of the lens of the eyeglasses of the operator wearing the helmet or the eye shield of the helmet can reach the condensation point of the breath of the wearer, water and/or ice will form on the eyeglass lens or on the eye shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To avoid the problem of condensation, it is possible to open the shield to allow outside air to flow into the helmet until the condensation is eliminated. This, however, presents a problem in that the wearer may be exposed to cold air, which is uncomfortable at the very least. Furthermore, the wearer has to use one hand to open the shield, which may be awkward when he or she is steering the vehicle being driven. The shield could also involuntarily close as a result of a sudden movement, which is potentially distracting. Thus, there is a need to provide a device which is capable of avoiding or eliminating the condensation created inside a full face helmet. There is a further need to provide such a device with an adjustment mechanism that can be manipulated by a wearer who is wearing gloves to protect his/her hands from the cold environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Prior art helmets provide some protection against the sun&apos;s rays. However, the shield of prior art helmets is either clear or tinted and adjustment of the tint is usually not possible. On a bright sunny day, the wearer of a prior art helmet also must wear tinted eyeglasses to protect himself against the intensity of light, if the shield of his helmet is clear. In changing weather conditions, the wearer may have to remove and/or replace his tinted eyeglasses (or sunglasses) as the intensity of light changes. Thus, a need has developed for a helmet with an adjustable tinted shield. Because, as discussed above, the helmet wearer typically will wear both gloves and a helmet in a cold environment, there is a need to provide a tinted shield adjustment mechanism that can be controlled by the wearer while the wearer is wearing gloves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Helmets that are adapted for cold-weather use are commonly equipped with electrically-heated eye shields that prevent water vapor from condensing and/or freezing on the eye shield. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,694,650 and 5,500,953 illustrate two examples of such heated eye shields. In each, an electric heating element extends across the eye shield, which is pivotally or otherwise movably connected to the helmet. The eye shield includes an electric connector that connects to an external power supply via power supply leads. If the wearer is riding a snowmobile, the power supply is typically the snowmobile&apos;s battery. In these conventional heated eye shields, the power supply leads act as tethers between the eye shield and the power source and tend to disadvantageously move the heated eye shield during use. There is therefore a need to provide an electrical connection between a heated eye shield and an external power source that does not tend to move the eye shield relative to the helmet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/075,992, which published on Aug. 8, 2002 as US 2002/0104533 A1 and is incorporated by reference herein, discloses another conventional helmet. The helmet comprises a head portion, a shield portion, and a breathing mask. The shield portion comprises a jaw shield and an eye shield. The jaw shield is pivotally connected to the head portion and can be pivoted downwardly into a closed position and upwardly into an open position. The eye shield is pivotally connected to the head portion and includes a see-through shield and a tinted shield. The tinted shield is pivotally connected to the eye shield and can be lowered inside the helmet to protect the wearer from sun rays and raised into an upper, enclosed portion of the eye shield. The breathing mask is hermetically adapted to the face of the wearer to evacuate the wearer&apos;s breath outside the helmet through breathing channels that extend laterally outwardly and rearwardly through the jaw shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In summary, there are several deficiencies in prior art helmets that necessitate an improved helmet design. This is especially true for the design of helmets specifically intended for cold weather use, such as for snowmobiling or the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Before delving into the specific details of the present invention, it should be noted that the conventions &ldquo;left,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;front,&rdquo; &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; are defined relative to the head of a wearer of a helmet. For example, a &ldquo;forward&rdquo; direction is the direction in which the wearer looks while wearing a helmet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side view of a helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is adapted to protect a majority of the wearer&apos;s head. A jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connects to a lower forward portion of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> together define an inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that is shaped to accommodate the head of the wearer. The inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opens to the exterior of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a semi-crescent-shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes when the wearer wears the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is defined between a forward edge of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an upper edge of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes left and right sides/portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that extend forwardly and laterally inwardly toward each other from left and right forward lower sides, respectively, of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generally from a convex arc around the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are integrally formed with the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, the sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may alternatively be formed separately from the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then rigidly attached to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> laterally-extending pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> extends between lower portions of the left and right forward, inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the left and right portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receiving opening is defined between the inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, an upper edge of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and a lower edge of the semi-crescent-shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The receiving opening is adapted to be disposed generally in front of a mouth and nose of the wearer of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has an attached position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) where the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rigidly held at a lower, front, middle portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., in the receiving opening for the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also has a detached position in which the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not rigidly attached to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference>). However, even in the detached position, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be tethered to the rest of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a tether cord (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is selectively attached to the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using a separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Details of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes two parts. One part is defined by the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, which preferably has a round cross-section. The other part is a C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that is attached to a lower, laterally-centered portion of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends laterally along the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> over a width that preferably generally corresponds to an exposed laterally-extending length of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The cross-section of the clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as it extends laterally, is defined by the C-shape. The opening of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; preferably aims generally forwardly and slightly downwardly when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While in the illustrated embodiment, the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is disposed on the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is disposed on the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the relative positions of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be interposed without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, because other types of separable hinges may also be used, the present invention is not limited to the hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, to engage the two parts of the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is aimed forwardly and downwardly in front of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is moved downwardly such that the C-shape engages the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can thereafter be pivoted upwardly and rearwardly toward the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> about a pivot axis defined by the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. When the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is pivoted fully into its attached position, the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> automatically rigidly engages upper portions of the fixed and detachable portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to prevent the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from pivoting away from the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The engagement between the outer lateral sides of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> prevents the C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from moving rearwardly relative to the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from separating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generally form a U shape. The lower edge of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also forms a U shape that mates with the U shape of the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the intersection between the fixed and detachable portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may take on a variety of other shapes (see, e.g., the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a partial front view of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with a front cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>) removed. The two lateral sides of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are mirror images of each other in the embodiment shown. Accordingly, only the left side will be described because the description applies to the right side as well. The left side of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that is pivotally connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may move in the direction indicated by the arrows. A resilient member (i.e., a spring, etc.) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends between the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to bias the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally outwardly (clockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). A hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about a generally horizontal axis so that the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may move in the directions indicated by the arrows. A resilient member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> (i.e., a torsion spring, a tension spring, etc.) extends between the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to bias a downwardly-pointing hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is formed at a laterally outward and rearward end of the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, downwardly into an engaged position (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is generally disposed at an upper, rearward, laterally-outward end of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> further includes a slot (or catch plate) <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> disposed at an upper end of the inner side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the left portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (and of the right portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To engage the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is engaged and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated upwardly toward the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> abut lower edges of the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated almost fully upwardly. The abutting contact pushes the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> upwardly against the biasing force of the resilient members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to pass into the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> thereafter rotate downwardly, under the biasing force of the resilient members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, to engage the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and rigidly hold the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> against the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To release the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the wearer depresses two triangularly-shaped protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally-inwardly. The levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are positioned to enable a wearer to depress both levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally inwardly by squeezing the protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> together with a single hand. The resulting inward lateral movement of the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> causes the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to engage second arms <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the hook arms <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, thereby rotating the hook arms <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> upwardly into a disengaged position relative to the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can thereafter be freely rotated outwardly and downwardly away from the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to allow the wearer to separate the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and detach the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Because the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes two independently operating hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the accidental actuation of just one of the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> will not release the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This safety feature prevents the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from accidentally releasing during use of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forms the forward side of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extend forwardly through triangularly shaped holes <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> on either lateral side of the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> utilizes left and right sets of hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, various other types of latch mechanisms may also be used to releasably secure the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the connection could be magnetic, rather than mechanical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position, rearward laterally-outward ends of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> engage sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> disposed on the forward inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). The sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> preferably comprise an elastically deformable material such as foam or rubber. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> discourage cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the detachable and fixed portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is adjustably connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via an adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> connects to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for free rotation relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about an axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. However, the connection between the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> prevents the knob from moving along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is specifically connected to the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, but may alternatively be connected to the main body of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> intersects a generally forward, middle portion of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and generally intersects the wearer&apos;s mouth and nose when the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> includes a central, internally-threaded bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> an outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes, on its outer semi-cylindrical surface, an externally-threaded portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that is threaded into the internally threaded bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) of the control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> such that the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connects to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via its connection to the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes an inner axially extending bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that extends along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> generally comprises a hollow, axially-extending tube that has a generally ring-shaped cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> An inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes an outer generally-cylindrical surface that telescopically fits into the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> also includes an internal axially-extending bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> when the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is fit into the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the outer semi-cylindrical surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes an axially-extending surface feature/stop (a flat portion in the illustrated embodiment) <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> that engages a corresponding axially-extending surface feature/stop <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> (also a flat portion in the illustrated embodiment) formed on the inside of the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to prevent the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to each other about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, while allowing the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to telescopically axially slide relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the outer semi-cylindrical surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the inside semi-cylindrical surface of the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also include annular stops <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (such as notches and/or protrusions) that discourage relative telescopic movement between the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 23</cross-reference>, a rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> flares radially-outwardly and rearwardly in the shape of a funnel. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a central bore <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> that is slightly larger than the generally-cylindrical outer surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> extends forwardly through the central bore <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. An annular, saucer-shaped, breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> also fits over the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to clamp the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> onto the rearward axial end of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> between the flared rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> cannot, therefore, move along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Because the rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> are both somewhat flexible, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can swivel relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In other words, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can pivot to some extent relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can therefore swivel to fit the face of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> ring-shaped upper end of an accordion-folded connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is clamped between the flared rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> in addition to the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is either rigidly clamped to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> or includes a notch that engages a corresponding protrusion in the inner axial member to prevent the upper end the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The locations of the notch and protrusion, of course, may be interposed. The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a piece of sheet metal that is folded in an accordion pattern, which provides at least a moderate amount of flexibility. A lower end of the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> generally prevents the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise a variety of other shapes and materials. For example, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may simply comprise a string or tether that connects between the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the detachable jaw portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to discourage the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, while the illustrated connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> comprises an accordion-shaped sheet of metal, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise a variety of other materials such as rubber, another elastomeric material, string, plastic, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes both fine and gross adjustment devices. The adjustment devices each move the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> along an axial path defined by the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can move (a) away from an interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and toward the mouth and nose of the wearer and (b) toward the interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and away from the mouth and nose of the wearer. Unlike prior art breathing mask adjustment devices that rely on flexible straps and the wearer&apos;s face to hold the breathing mask in place, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> controls the position of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> regardless of whether or not the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can hold the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s nose and mouth while the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without having the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> come in contact with the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Gross adjustment of the breathing mask is performed by pushing or pulling the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to telescopically move relative to each other despite the frictional resistance to such telescopic movement created by the annular stops <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> on the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Gross adjustment can be performed while the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is detached from the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but not in the attached position, or when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Once the gross adjustment of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is completed, the wearer uses the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to finely adjust the axial position of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Fine adjustment is preferably performed while the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position such that the wearer can accurately and precisely position the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> against his/her mouth and nose to prevent humid exhaled air from escaping out of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> preferably includes surface features such as protrusions and/or notches <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that make it easier for the wearer to turn the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with his/her gloved hand. By rotating the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with his/her hand, the threaded engagement between the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> causes the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (and consequently the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) to move along the axial path. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be rotated in either direction, resulting in movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> toward or away from the inner surface of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pitch of the threads on the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> determine the magnitude of axial movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> per degree of rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If right-hand threads are used on the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, clockwise rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) will push the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> outwardly toward the interior surface of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and away from the wearer&apos;s mouth and nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> For rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to force the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to move axially, the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> should not rotate significantly with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is therefore prevented from rotating significantly with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> because of the rotational engagement of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which is prevented from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that other systems may alternatively be used to prevent the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from rotating with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. For example, an axially extending notch or protrusion could be formed in the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and mate with a radially-inwardly extending notch or protrusion that is rigidly connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Such mating notches/protrusions would directly prevent the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could rely on a general contact between the wearer&apos;s face and the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to prevent the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (and, consequently, the outer and inner axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during operation of the fine adjustment device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, left and right inlet air passageways (or openings) <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are formed in the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to fluidly connect the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an inner portion (or breathing space) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and allow the wearer to inhale air from within the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Check valves <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> disposed within the inlet air passages <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> discourage humid exhaled air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and condensing within the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the wearer inhales air from within the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the inhaled air is at least slightly warmed (relative to the ambient environment) and air continuously circulates into and out of the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Fresh air enters the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through any openings/gaps in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, especially at the neck of the wearer. While the illustrated air inlet passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are quite short (i.e., extending only over the thickness of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), the air inlet passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise elongated tubular passageways that have a variety of lengths and/or cross-sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The internal bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the internal bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> combine to define an exhaust air passageway (or opening) <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> fluidly connects the inner portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the ambient environment to allow humid air exhaled by the wearer to vent outwardly without getting into the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> check valve <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is disposed in the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to prevent ambient air outside the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from entering the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. While the illustrated exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> comprises an elongated tube, the passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may alternatively be short in an axial direction. While the cross-sectional shape of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is generally circular in this embodiment, the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may have a variety of alternative tubular shapes (for example, rectangular, oval, irregular, polygonal, or varying shapes) without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The center of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, when a person <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> wears the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the exhaust air passage <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> angle downwardly as the air passageway projects away from the mouth and nose of the person <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight>. Because an external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is disposed below an internal end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, humid exhaled air that condenses in the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> will tend to flow under the force of gravity down the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and out of the external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opens up to the ambient environment in a forward and downward direction. Consequently, condensed water will tend not to accumulate or freeze within the passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends linearly such that the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> defines its center, exhaust air passageways according to the present invention may have a variety of alternative longitudinal shapes (e.g., center lines that include simple or compound curves, irregular shapes, angles, etc.). Regardless of the specific longitudinal shape of the exhaust air passageway, the air passageway should generally extend downwardly as it extends away from the wearer&apos;s face so that condensed water tends to flow out of the air passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> To discourage fresh air from being forced into the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> as the wearer travels forwardly on a vehicle, an air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>) fits into the inner bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and is positioned in front of the external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to deflect air away from the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is open on its sides to allow exhaled air to exit the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and the exhaust air check valve <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> combine to generally discourage ambient fresh air from entering the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. Consequently, more warm exhaled air than cold ambient air moves through the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, which generally raises the temperature within the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and discourages the humid exhaust air from condensing and freezing within the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. This discourages ice from building up within and clogging the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> While separate exhaust and inlet air passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> are preferred, the inlet air passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and check valves <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> may be eliminated such that the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> serves as a passageway for both inlet/fresh air and exhaled humid air without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Various modifications to the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be made without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, just one of the two adjustment devices (telescopic/rotational) may be used. Further, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> instead of to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may freely rotate relative to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, but be prevented from moving axially relative to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may include external threads that would mesh with internal threads rigidly formed in a bore in the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Additional changes and modifications may also be made to the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the present invention, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected by left and right bolts <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally extending tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is pivotally movable between (a) a raised position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is at least partially above the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and substantially out of the wearer&apos;s field of vision (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), and (b) a lowered position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed in the semi-crescent shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> connects between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to bias the tinted shield into its raised position. Alternatively, the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> could connect between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and an eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The illustrated resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is a torsion spring that is pre-tensioned before the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the torsion spring <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> urges the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> upwardly (clockwise as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) into its raised position so that the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> will not fall into its lowered position under the force of gravity or some jostling movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> comprises a semi-spherical semi-crescent shaped tinted see-through portion <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> with left and right sides <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> riveted or otherwise attached to the laterally-outer ends of the see-through portion <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lower edge of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> generally follows the contours of the upper edge of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a partial side view of the left inside of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> with the tinted shield removed from the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A hole <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> through which the bolt <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> fits is disposed through the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is disposed between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to selectively hold the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in its lowered position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The illustrated holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> includes a rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that is formed on the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The long edges of the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are generally perpendicular to a line that connects between the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a middle of the long edges of the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is radially spaced from the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> disposed on the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. When the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the shallowly-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> face rearwardly and the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> face forwardly. The teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> are generally aligned with a forward small edge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> disposed on an outer lateral side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> radially outwardly from the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The steeply-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> face forwardly and slightly downwardly while the shallowly-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> face rearwardly and slightly upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are positioned so as to not engage the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position. However, when the tinted shield is pivoted toward and into the lowered position, the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are positioned to engage the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. When the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> meet each other, their respective shallowly-sloped sides first engage each other, thereby forcing the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> outwardly. Because the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is made of a flexible material such as plastic, the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> flexes outwardly (generally about the small edge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>) away from the head portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The outward movement of the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> enables the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to slide over the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> until the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> flexes back into its unflexed position, at which point the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> engage the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to prevent the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from rotating back into its raised position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Because there are a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a plurality of lowered positions of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are defined, one lowered position for each possible combination of mating teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A variety of other types of holding devices may be used instead of the illustrated ratchet-teeth-based holding device, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference> illustrates a helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> that includes an alternative holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> may replace the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Because the helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is similar to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a redundant description of each of the similar elements is omitted. The helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, a jaw shield <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, an eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, and a tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> disposed between the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally extending tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. The tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is pivotally movable between (a) a raised position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is at least partially above an opening <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> formed between the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and substantially out of the wearer&apos;s field of vision (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>), and (b) a lowered position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is disposed in the semi-crescent shaped opening <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> connects between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> to bias the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> into its raised position. In this embodiment, the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is a resilient plastic spring that is connected at one end to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and at an opposite end to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. Because the plastic spring <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is resiliently bent around a base portion of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> biases the tinted shield into its raised position. While the illustrated resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is a plastic spring, a variety of other resilient members may alternatively be used to bias the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> upwardly (for example, a torsion spring such as the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> rubber band or other tensile piece of rubber, a tension spring, a compression spring, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is disposed between the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and the head portion. The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> selectively holds the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> in its lowered position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> and a detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, which selectively engage each other to hold the tinted shield in the lowered position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from one side of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. The illustrated lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the base portion of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, but may alternatively be otherwise attached to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> (via, for example, glue, bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> pivots with the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> about the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> comprises a flexible material that enables an upper portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> to flex in the direction of the tinted shield axis (into and out of the page as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> protrudes inwardly from an upper rearward portion of the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. However, the detent may alternatively be otherwise attached to the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> (via, for example, glue, bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). A forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> abuts against a rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> to prevent the tinted shield from moving from its lowered position into its raised position when the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is lowered. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> are both in their lowered positions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> into its raised position pivots the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> rearwardly away from the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight>, which allows the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> to move into its raised position under the force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> are both in their lowered positions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may be raised without raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by pressing the upper, exposed portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. Pressing the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly causes its upper portion to flex inwardly and its rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to disengage from the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and pivot rearwardly past the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This, in turn, allows the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> to move into its raised position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> A rearward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> angles inwardly toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> as it progresses forwardly toward the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Consequently, the detent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a generally ramp-like shape when viewed from above. When the eye shield is in the lowered position and the tinted shield is in its raise position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>), the wearer can lower the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by pushing the exposed portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> forward (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>). As the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> passes the detent, the ramp-like, rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>flexes the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly so that it can slide past the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Once the rearward surface of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> moves in front of the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> flexes outwardly and engages the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to hold the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> in its lowered position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The illustrated detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is mounted to the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> such that the holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> controls relative movement between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. However, the detent could alternatively be mounted to the head portion such that the holding device would control the position of the tinted shield relative to the head portion (see, e.g., the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>). In such an embodiment, the wearer would push the lever outwardly rather than inwardly to raise the tinted shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the tinted shield control lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for rotation relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally-extending lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. However, it should be noted that the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> could alternatively pivot about the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Returning to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an oblong hole <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> in the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> fits over a protrusion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that defines the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the lever is constrained by the hole <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and protrusion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> to pivotal movement over a fixed, preferably acute arc. A resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> connects between the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to bias the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> into a neutral position that is part way between the extreme pivotal positions of the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> over the fixed arc. The resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a bi-directional torsion spring, but could alternatively comprise any other type of resilient member such as a rubber/elastic band, a tension spring, a compression spring, a combination of several resilient members, etc. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> designed to be grasped by the wearer&apos;s gloved hand. The handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can be pulled downwardly to pivot the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> downwardly (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) relative to the neutral position in a tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> lowering direction. Conversely, the handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can be pushed upwardly to pivot the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> upwardly (clockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), relative to the neutral position, in a tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> raising direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>. An inwardly-extending lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> formed on the inside of the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) fits into the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in the lowering direction, an upper edge <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> engages the lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and pulls the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> downwardly (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) into its lowered position. As discussed above, the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the holding device automatically lock the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> into the lowered position to prevent the tinted shield from moving upwardly under the force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the wearer releases the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and allows it to return to its neutral position under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> remains in its lowered position. The raising force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> prevents the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from pivoting downwardly further unless the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is again pushed downwardly to further lower the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> further includes a raising wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>. The wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> is positioned on the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> such that when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in its raising direction, the wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> contacts the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the holding device. Thereafter, a sloped surface of the wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> slidingly engages the shallowly-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> laterally-outwardly until the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> disengage the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> disengage from each other, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> freely pivots upwardly into its raised position under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> of the lever is long enough in an annular direction relative to the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> that the edges of the hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> do not engage the lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in the raising direction. Alternatively, the entire lower side of the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> could be eliminated such that the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> comprises just a lowering upper edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> bumper <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> is provided on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a position corresponding to an upper edge of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position. The bumper <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> cushions the impact force of the upwardly-moving tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is thrust upwardly under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a protective eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The pivotal connection between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably includes frictional surfaces that discourage pivotal movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will only pivot between its raised and lowered positions when pushed/pulled by the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</cross-reference>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises a double-layer, semi-crescent-shaped clear shield that includes an outer, semi-spherical, semi-crescent shaped layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and an inner, semi-cylindrically shaped layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> curves from left to right as it progresses around the inside of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, tabs <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> extend inwardly from the inner side of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to hold the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in place between the tabs <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The perimeter of the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> includes a ribbon <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of silicon that seals the two layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> together such that an air space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is formed between the layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The air space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> forms a thermal barrier that discourages condensation on the inner side of the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer side of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to ensure that the wearer has a clear field of vision through the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. While a double-layer eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferred, the eye shield may alternatively comprise a single layer shield without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> could alternatively both be semi-spherically shaped or both be semi-cylindrically shaped, or both have asymmetrical shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 12</cross-reference>, a lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends downwardly away from the remainder of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., generally perpendicularly to a radial direction of the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>). Consequently, when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is lowered into its lowered position, its lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engages sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> disposed on the jaw shield <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create a tight seal that discourages cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a resilient material such as foam or rubber. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> preferably have a tubular cross-section that includes a longitudinally extending cut through which the lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is moved into its lower position. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are fastened to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within channels <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> that are formed in and extend around an upper perimeter of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends into the channel <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> To further discourage cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is contoured to closely follow the contours of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. While not shown in this embodiment, a sealing strip may be provided on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to seal the small gap formed between the upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, while the tinted and eye shields <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> pivot about separate axes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, respectively, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be modified such that both shields <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> would pivot about the same axis without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> extends downwardly enough that it is disposed below the lower edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> even when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed behind the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (i.e., closer to the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and closer to the wearer) regardless of whether the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised or lowered positions. Consequently, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be raised and lowered using the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> even when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> therefore advantageously eliminates the need to raise the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in order to reposition the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the eye shield has upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The lower portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is the portion that is disposed in front of the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position and is see-through or clear so that the wearer can see through the lowered eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is disposed above the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> regardless of the position of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position and the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position, the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is disposed in front of the tinted shield. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is see-through or clear so that the raised tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be inspected through the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> While the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is clear in the illustrated embodiment, it is also contemplated that the upper portion of the eye shield is opaque or tinted. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates an eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> that may replace the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Except as expressly stated herein, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is identical to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. A lower portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is clear to enable the wearer to see through the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. An upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is opaque. The opaque upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be created by applying a frosted or opaque layer to the inside of an otherwise see-through portion. For example, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> may be created by applying an opaque layer (spay paint, paint, etc.) to the interior side of the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Although the opaque layer may alternatively be applied to the outside of the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the interior side is preferred so that the opaque layer is less exposed to wear and abrasion. Alternatively, the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may comprise a material such as plastic that is inherently opaque. In such an embodiment, the lower portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>would comprise distinct materials. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position, and the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position, the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>hides the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes an eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> that electrically heats the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to discourage water and frost from forming on the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and obstructing the wearer&apos;s view. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an outwardly looking side view of the inner right side of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. An electric heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, which preferably comprises a thin wire, extends within the space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> defined between outer and inner layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. One end of the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a forward electrical contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> disposed on the inside surface of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is disposed forwardly from and radially outwardly from the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> covers an arc, which has the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> as its centerline. The other end of the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a rearward electrical contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, which is generally a mirror image of the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> relative to the axis <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. The forward and rearward contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> each comprise electrically-conductive laterally-inner surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the eye shield heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> further includes forward and rearward sets of electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> disposed forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, from the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> on the right lateral side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to an external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> mounted on the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is adapted to be connected via a power lead (not shown) to an electrical power source such as a snowmobile&apos;s battery system. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a sealing ring <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to protect the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> from the outside environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> continuously, slidingly, electrically engages at least one of the forward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> throughout the pivotal range of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the rearward contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> continuously, slidingly, electrically engages at least one of the rearward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> throughout the pivotal range of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is continuously electrically connected to the external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the electrical connection between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that is defined by the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> could be positioned such that the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> only electrically engages one of the forward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. The same may be true for the rearward contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and the rearward contact points <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. Consequently, lowering the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> into the lowered position turns on the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> turns off the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Because the power supply lead is adapted to be attached to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> instead of directly to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, as is known in conventional eye shield heating systems, the power supply lead cannot act as a tether and apply a raising or lowering force to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the power supply lead does not interfere with the wearer&apos;s operation of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a mounting bracket <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for a flashlight or other type of external, removable gear. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flashlight <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is mounted to the mounting bracket <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The mounting bracket may include electrical contacts similar to the contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of the eye shield heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Such contacts would provide electrical power to the flashlight and be electrically connected to the external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Additional features may also be provided on the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, a rear light may be installed on the back side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lights are LEDs that are preferably connected to a vehicle power supply in the same manner as the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> A communications system may also be installed in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the wearer can communicate with the wearer of a second helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or second communications system. Such a communications system would be particularly advantageous for use by a driver and passenger of a snowmobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrate a helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Like the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. Also as in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> included two fixed side portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and a detachable center portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> like the previously described separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> selectively connects the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> to the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. Inner sides <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> of the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> are generally planar, but may alternatively be curved, bumped, convex, concave, angled, etc. Accordingly, as viewed from the front, the inner sides <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> generally form a V shape (as opposed to the generally U shape of the inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). In use, this V-shaped opening generally forms a funnel that guides the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> into alignment with the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> when a wearer attempts to engage the separable pieces (e.g., a C-shaped clip and a pin) of the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> that is operatively connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> via a mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> and mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> are similar to the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a redundant detailed description of the similar or identical features and structures is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 14A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> includes a control knob assembly <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight> that differs from the control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the previously described mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The control knob assembly <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight> includes a control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> connected to a ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. As in the previous embodiment, the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is mounted to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> for relative pivotal movement about a pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. However, the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> cannot move axially along the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is connected to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in a gimbal fashion that allows the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to swivel relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> but ensures that the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> rotates with the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. To allow swiveling movement, the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> includes two pivot pins <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> that fit into slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> formed inside the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> allow the pivot pins <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> to slide axially (along the axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>) to some extent and allow the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to pivot relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> about their own axes. An inner circumferential surface of the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> includes threads <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> that mesh with the external threads of an outer axial member (not shown) that is functionally identical to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. The threads <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> define a second pivot axis <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> when the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is in a neutral position within the slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> but forms an angle with the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> when the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> moves within the slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. The gimbal connection between the control knob <highlight><bold>8000</bold></highlight> and the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> allows the breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> to translate slightly up, down, left, and right relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, which allows the breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> to be positioned in a greater variety of positions within the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> than the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the previously described embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 16</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes an eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> that is similar to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> connects to the head portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> for relative pivotal movement about an eye shield pivot axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. The eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a heating system <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> that electrically heats the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to discourage water and frost from forming on the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and obstructing the wearer&apos;s view. An electric heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, which preferably comprises a thin wire, extends within the space defined between outer and inner layers of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. A bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> is formed in one side of the head portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The bore is aligned with the eye shield axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. Electrically insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> extend inwardly into the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> through the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>. At least a small amount of slack in the insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is preferably provided within the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> to ensure that the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the pivotal operation of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Within the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extend between a hard outer shell of the head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a soft internal cushion of the head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to an electrical power supply jack mounted on the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. the electrical power supply jack is adapted to be removably electrically connected to an electrical power source such as a snowmobile&apos;s battery system. Because the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> extends through the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> at the axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the pivotal movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, because the connection between the power supply and the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not require the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> to be disposed on an outside of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not get caught on objects outside the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> generally show the progressive detachment of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> from the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is attached to the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is lowered. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is then raised. While removing the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> of the illustrated helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> requires the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to be at least partially raised, a helmet according to the present invention may alternatively be designed such that the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may be removed without raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> latch mechanism like the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the previous embodiment may be released to allow the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> to pivot outwardly away from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> about the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may then be pivoted outwardly and downwardly away from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 21</cross-reference>, the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> may subsequently be completely separated to separate the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> illustrate a helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. To avoid redundant disclosure, an exhaustive description of the elements of the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> that are similar to or identical to the previously described embodiments is omitted. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, and a breathing mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> operatively connecting the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to (or integrally formed with) the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. However, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, or a portion of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> may alternatively be movably connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, as is described above in connection with one or more of the previous embodiments. The head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> together define an inner space <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The breathing mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> adjustably connects the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> so as to selectively move the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> within the inner space <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> (a) away from an interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> and toward the mouth and nose of the wearer, and (b) toward the interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> and away from the mouth and nose of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> comprises a control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>, an axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>, and a retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> connects to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> for relatively free rotation relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> about an adjustment mechanism axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>). However, the connection between the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> prevents the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> from moving along the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> includes a central, internally-threaded bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> includes an externally threaded portion <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> that is threaded into the internally threaded bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> of the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> such that the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, an axially extending keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer surface of the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>. The retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> mounts to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. While the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> is bolted to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment, the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> may alternatively be connected in any other fashion (for example, integral formation, glue, screws, rivets). When the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> is threaded into the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> of the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>, the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> engages the keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, which prevents the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. While a keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> and retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> are used in the illustrated embodiment to discourage the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, a variety of other structures may be used to accomplish this task without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, an accordion-folded connector such as the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and discussed above may be used. Moreover, the adjustment mechanism may alternatively rely on engagement between the wearer&apos;s face and the breathing mask to discourage the axial member from rotating relative to the wearer, the helmet, and the jaw shield about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> To adjust the adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>, the helmet wearer rotates the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. The resulting relative rotation of the threads of the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> causes the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> and the attached breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to telescopically move along the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> and keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> ensure that rotation of the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> will cause telescopic movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> by preventing the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating with the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. The wearer can therefore use the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> to snugly fit the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> against his/her mouth and nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> defines an axially extending opening <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> that fluidly connects the breathing space within the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Together, the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> define an exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> that fluidly connects the breathing space within the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the ambient environment outside the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> is generally aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> and is positioned such that it extends downwardly and forwardly as it progresses away from the mouth and nose of the wearer when the wearer wears the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The foregoing illustrated embodiments are provided to illustrate the structural and functional principles of the present invention and are not intended to be limiting. To the contrary, the principles of the present invention are intended to encompass any and all changes, alterations and/or substitutions within the spirit and scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to protective garments and more particularly to a protective vest and head gear for use in hazardous activities, as for example, riding a motorcycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art and Objects </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For sometime, it has become commonplace for persons engaged in a hazardous activity to wear protective head gear. Motorcycle operators in many jurisdictions are required to wear a helmet and construction and factory workers are required to wear protective head gear frequently referred to as &ldquo;hard hats.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Absolute total protection for the entire body from all hazardous activities is not possible, at least in a manner that permits the wearer to perform the desired activity. However, what further protection can be achieved is highly desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Motorcycle operation is particularly hazardous as the operator is totally exposed except possible for a helmet and possible a leather jacket and leather pants. However, motorcycles are increasing popular, frequently being operated by professionals and business executives. Unfortunately, with motorcycle operation, there is ultimately a near certainty that an accident will occur. Some of those accidents will result in limited injury but serious injury is a realty of motorcycle operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The body torso contains vital organs most vulnerable to injury. The head is protected by a helmet but the torso of the body including the body, chest and abdomen can receive a hard impact resulting in serious injury and even death. Even with a helmet in place, the neck also can be seriously injured unless excessive movement of the head is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the Scaglione Patent, U. S. Pat. No. 6,253,389, a protective garment is described and claimed. The device, described in the patent works well to protect the wearer but a need still exists for a more user friendly device without compromising safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an object of this investigation to provide a protective garment to shield the torso from injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a protective garment that protects the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a protective garment including both a vest and helmet that can be easily worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a protective garment that is comparatively inexpensive to produce and of pleasant appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art as the description thereof proceeds. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A protective garment for the head neck and torso of the body of a person wearing the protective garment which includes a helmet and a vest which vest has a back section, a left front section and a right section. The helmet has a head section with a visor and a neck section and a front section which is partially coextensive with the neck section, the front section being capable of being opened. The left front section and the right front section are mounted to rotate on the back section to bring the left front section and the right front section together. The left front section has an upper left section which is rigid and a lower left front section which is flexible. The right front section has an upper right front section which is rigid and a lower right hand section which is flexible. A fastening means secures the left front section and the right front section together. The helmet has a lower edge and the vest has an upper edge. A means is provided at the lower edge of the helmet and at the upper edge of the vest to secure the helmet to the vest and to permit the helmet to rotate on the vest.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the protective garment includes a helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is similar to known helmets now worn by motorcycles operators and has a head section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which fits about the neck. The neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which is also the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is essentially circular. A visor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is located in the front of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the head section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to permit the obviously essential visibility and can be rotated open about pivots <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A feature of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is distinctive from helmets currently known, is a flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is a protrusion extending outwardly from the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generally at right angles to the vertical axis <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as worn. The flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> also extends continuously about the entire lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thus is essentially circular as is the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Beneath the visor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and partially coextensive with the neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is put on the head by opening the front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is hinged on the left side by a hinge (not shown). The front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then secured by a locking device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A vent <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is located in the front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to permit air to enter the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has three major sections, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, namely a back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has an upper left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A and a lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, has an upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> A and a lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B. The terms &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; are consistent with the left and right sides and arms of one wearing the protective garment. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are generally each a quarter of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and are both located on the front of the wearer to cover the chest and abdomen of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The upper left section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A is at the top of the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and is substantially smaller than the lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B. The upper left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A is made from a hard substance, as is the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> while the lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B is made of a material such as heavy duty leather which prevents abrasions and provides at least limited flexibility. Similarly, the upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A is at the top of the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and is substantially smaller than the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B. The upper left front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A is also made from a hard substance while the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B is also made from a material such as leather that is highly protective but flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The upper left section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A and the lower lleft front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B join one another at a seam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>C. Similarly, the upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B join one another at a seam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> covers the back and represents approximately one-half of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has an upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is connected to the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> about the neck of the wearer and a lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which fits about the waist of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed as part of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is part of the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is circular when the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are secured to one another and the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extends about all the way around the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> protrudes outside the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and has an internal surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with an indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the internal surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Within the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are partially recessed roller bearings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is horizontal and is adapted to receive the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, when in the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is permitted to glide on the roller bearings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this way, with the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> closed and with the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> completely encasing the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> readily rotates with the turning of the head of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, when folded together, come in very close proximity to one another and are joined in the center of the front of the protective garment by a fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, preferably a slide fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> having two sets of interlocking teeth <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has a left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. When the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is closed, the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are in close proximity to one another and face one another. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is mounted on both the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and has a upper end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In order to engage the fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> must be folded together with the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> facing one another as just explained. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> permits complete release between the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In both the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, toward the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed. In the back section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, two semicircular openings <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are formed, one of which matches the semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to form a left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the other semicircular opening <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the back section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> mates with the semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to form a right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are generally aligned with one another and are generally equally spaced from the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extends from the right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends from the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Both the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> form a slight overlap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Directly above the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, separate pins <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> join respectively the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and joins the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The left pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is aligned with the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> rotates on the left pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The right pin (not shown) is aligned with the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates on the right pin (not shown) and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are preferably made a tough flexible material such as used in seatbelts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of any suitable design is mounted on the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> across the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> serves to assure that the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will not open on impact thus also assuring that the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will remain secured to the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To wear the protective garment, the wearer places the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> open and with the part of the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> held on the arms, the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed on the head and the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is fitted into the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are then folded together with the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sliding into the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are then both secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, while a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects. The appended claims are therefore intended to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to portable spas and, more particularly, to a spa which may be installed either in the ground or above the ground without hindering access to the technical equipment necessary for operation of the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, there have been two distinct types of spas, permanent in-ground spas and portable spas that can be installed either above or below the ground. In-ground spas consist essentially of a shell installed in the ground that includes hydro-jets around its perimeter designed to circulate heated water within the spa. Plumbing to the hydro-jets must be installed underground and routed to the spa from a remote maintenance area which houses the necessary technical equipment, such as the pumps, heaters, filters and valves. While in-ground spas are generally considered more aesthetically pleasing than portable spas, they are also relative expensive and time consuming to install and are virtually impossible to remove and subsequently install at a different location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Portable spas are usually stand-alone upright structures in which the water reservoir and all of the plumbing and technical equipment are within a single self-contained unit. These spas are advantageous in that they are easily installed above the ground without excavating the ground, and they can be moved to another location with little or no damage to the spa itself. Since portable spas are typically about three to four feet tall, a deck, or at least a set of stairs, is often built around the top of the spa to enhance the spa&apos;s appearance as well as provide easier accessibility for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In some cases, owners of portable spas will install the spa below ground level to simulate the appearance of a permanent in-ground spa. However, the current industry rules governing underground installation of portable spas requires excavation of a hole larger than the spa itself, and the construction of a retaining wall or other suitable barrier to keep the pressure of the surrounding earth off the side walls of the spa. This undesirably adds to the installation expense and requires construction of a deck or the like to cover the gap between the top of the spa and the retaining wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Portable spas have traditionally provided access to the technical equipment (i.e., pumps, heater, etc.) through an equipment access door in one of the side walls of the spa. If the spa is installed above the ground, with a deck built around the spa, the deck must include a door or hole in one side to reach the spa&apos;s equipment access door. This has the disadvantage that it detracts from the appearance of the deck while increasing the expense. It also may be inconvenient to maintain or repair the spa&apos;s equipment, since one must crawl under the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Similar disadvantages arise when a portable spa is installed below ground level. In these cases, the retaining wall in the excavated hole must be considerably wider than the spa itself to provide room to reach the spa&apos;s equipment access door at the side of the spa. Not only is the cover for this hole (in the deck between the spa and the retaining wall) usually unattractive, but the hole itself poses a potential safety hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has existed a definite need for a universal portable spa than can be installed either above the ground or below the ground, while simultaneously providing access to the technical equipment, and without sacrificing appearance and safety. There has also existed a need for a portable spa that is easier to install, repair and maintain. The present invention satisfies these needs and provides further related advantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a spa for use in heating and circulating water in the form of a self-contained unit having all of the equipment necessary for operation of the spa. The spa is capable of either above-ground installation in the manner of a portable spa or direct in-ground installation in the manner of a permanently installed spa. In either case, regardless of the manner of installation, access to the equipment for operation of the spa is convenient and not hindered in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The spa comprises a reservoir for holding water and an outer wall surrounding the reservoir. An equipment bay containing all of the equipment necessary for operation of the spa is located in and accessible from an opening of the top portion of the spa between the outer wall and the reservoir. A cover over the opening to the equipment bay is opened from the top portion of the spa to permit access to all of the equipment in the equipment bay. Thus, access to the equipment is provided in a safe and convenient fashion, free of any obstructions that may be around the outer wall at the side of the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the opening to the equipment bay is provided in a substantially horizontal coping that joins the reservoir to the outer wall. When the cover is closed, it may be sealed to the opening in a substantially water-tight manner so that the equipment in the equipment bay, such as a heater, pump and related control equipment, can be free of water intrusion. The spa also includes a water filter in a filtration compartment normally flooded with water from the reservoir, and filter cartridges for filtering impurities from the water. The filtration compartment is normally separated from the equipment which may be housed in a separate equipment compartment, and the two compartments need not be covered by the same cover. However, for convenience, the two compartments may be located side-by-side and share a common cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, reinforcing means are provided between the outer wall and the reservoir for supporting the outer wall against deformation from external forces. When the spa is installed below ground level, the reinforcing means withstands the external forces from excavated ground that is in direct contact with, and therefore applies pressure directly against, the outer wall. The reinforcing means may comprise a plurality of internal support elements, it may comprise a dense foam material, or it may comprise a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the reinforcing means, the support elements comprise a framework including a plurality of horizontal bottom support elements, a plurality of horizontal top support elements, and a plurality of vertical support elements that connect the bottom support elements to the top support elements. A plurality of bracing elements connected at an angle between the vertical support elements and the horizontal bottom support elements assist in supporting the framework and, thus, the outer wall against deformation from lateral external forces. This framework may be comprised of pressure-treated wood or other suitable materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In an alternative form of the invention, the opening to the equipment bay may be provided in the outer wall at a side of the spa. A shield is provided over the opening that can, like the reinforcing means, withstand deformation from external forces, for example, from the ground surrounding the spa. The shield is spaced from the opening such that the spa can be installed below ground level, and the equipment bay can be accessed by removing the cover over the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The spa of the present invention is extremely versatile, as it can be installed either above ground or below ground level, while still providing a means to access the equipment necessary to operate the spa. Access to the equipment is both convenient and safe, and the overall appearance of the spa and its surrounding environment can be made to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For example, if the spa is installed above the ground, a wood deck may be constructed around the spa, without requiring a side access door or a top access door in the deck, since access to the equipment bay can be reached from the top of the spa. Similarly, the spa can be installed directly in the ground and the excavated earth can be applied directly to the side of the spa, to simulate the appearance of a permanent in-ground spa. No retaining walls or other type of barriers are needed. Thus, the resulting spa has enhanced utility, as it may be portable or permanently installed at the option of the user. It is also relatively easy and inexpensive to install, repair and maintain, without any underground pipes and attendant problems from leaks or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

The spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of either above-ground installation, in which a raised deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be constructed around the spa, or direct in-ground installation, in which the spa is installed in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the earth directly in contact with the side of the spa. In either case, access to the equipment required for service of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is convenient and not hindered in any way by the manner of installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> installed directly in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, whether the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or above the ground, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the basic structure of the spa is still the same. It is defined by a shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which may be constructed of fiberglass, acrylic, high-impact thermoplastic materials, or any other suitable lightweight, high-strength material not easily susceptible to damage from water or sunlight. The shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be molded in a single unit, but more commonly it is a combination of several pieces joined together by adhesives or fasteners or by similar methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises an outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that defines the outer shape of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and functions as a housing to enclose all of the remaining elements of the spa. In particular, the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a vertical side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a horizontal bottom wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A horizontal coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along the upper surface of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a smooth transition from the vertical side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to an internal water reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> designed to hold a quantity of water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and at least one person <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably filled with a stiff insulating material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such as a dense Styrofoam or the like. The insulating material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> increases the structural integrity of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as well as its insulating qualities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is included in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for the user&apos;s ease and safety while entering the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and bench seats <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are included for the user to sit or lounge in the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A foot well <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also typically included in the center of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Multiple hydro-jets (not shown) located around the perimeter of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provide powerful streams of heated water that vigorously circulate the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the reservoir. It will be understood that the arrangement of the step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, seats <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, foot well <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (and hydro-jets) illustrated in the drawings is but one possible configuration, and many other arrangements could be used. In addition, in cases where the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed above the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an optional drainage line (not shown) originating at the lowest point of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and terminating outside of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be included to assist in draining of the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is considerably wider at one side of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> than any other. The coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is enlarged in this area to provide an opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> leading to an equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has two sections comprising an equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, both of which are located between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the internal reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in close proximity such that a single cover may be used to cover both. However, it is not a necessary requirement of this invention that the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> be located next to each other or that they share a common cover. Thus, a cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are shown. For convenience, both of these covers will be referred to as the cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes a skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that provides a water flow path from the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, the water level in the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is maintained essentially at the same level as that in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the lower edge of the skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is just below the water level so that only water from the uppermost surface of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can enter the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also preferably includes an inwardly hinged skimmer door <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or the like that allows water and floating debris from the upper surface of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to enter filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In the event that a wave or backflow causes water from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to flow back into the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the skimmer door <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will be forced to close. Thus, floating debris that enters the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will remain trapped therein until the user removes it during a periodic cleaning. A filter cartridge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located near the bottom of the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> serves to filter impurities in the water before it travels from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and on to the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The filter cartridges <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are removable so that they can be periodically cleaned or replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Unlike the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is not flooded with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is isolated from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a vertical wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> houses a conventional water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (or pumps as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), such as a motor-driven impeller-type water pump. It also houses a conventional water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for heating the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and maintaining a desired water temperature within the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A control box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> houses the necessary controls for controlling operation of the water pumps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and any other necessary equipment. A sump pump <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is located in the lower-most portion of the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and serves to remove any excess water that might leak or be splashed into the compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or, when installed in-ground, any water resulting from fluctuation in water table levels. Power to operate the water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is supplied from an external electrical source (not shown) through a conventional hookup that may be located just below the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> draws water from the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and into the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> through an intake pipe <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. After passing through the heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is returned to the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by an output pipe <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that distributes the heated water to the one or more hydro-jets located in various positions around the sides of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The intake and output pipes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are preferably constructed of polyvinylchloride, but could also be made of other lightweight, noncorrosive materials. If it is desired to create a low-maintenance water treatment in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a feature traditionally associated with spas of this type, the output pipe <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may also include an ozone generator (not shown) that mixes ozone gas with the water flow before it enters the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be installed above ground level, in the manner of a portable spa or, alternatively, it may be installed below ground level, in the manner of a permanently installed in-ground spa. If above-ground installation is desired, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, one simply needs to place the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a firm and level area (such as on a concrete pad or hard-packed earth), fill the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and connect the power source. Since the side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa are typically several feet high, an elevated deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also be built around the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to improve accessibility and appearance. Many variations of decks will serve this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Importantly, the elevated deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not require an equipment access door, either in the side or on the top of the deck, in order to gain access to the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This is because all of the equipment in the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be conveniently reached by removing the cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at the top of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Hence, unsightly and potentially unsafe access doors in the deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are avoided, as is the extra expense to make them. Moreover, the ease with which the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be reached is substantially enhanced. This is no need to crawl under the deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through a side access door, or down through an access door in the top of the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be installed below ground level, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a hole just slightly larger than the spa must be excavated. Once the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in the hole, which may be as deep as the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, some of the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that was excavated may be replaced directly around the walls of the spa, thus locking the spa into place. The reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can then be filled with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the power source can be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Importantly, no retaining wall or other type of barrier needs to be installed to keep the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> away from the side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, since the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a self-contained unit having all of the necessary equipment to operate the spa, there is no need for additional excavation for plumbing, such as output pipes or hydro-jets. Again, only the power source needs to be connected, and since it is located just below the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, it also does not require additional excavation. Thus, the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be easily installed in areas where space is limited, and it may be installed in virtually any orientation desired by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even though the entire side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is buried underground, access to the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is easily and conveniently accomplished through the top access cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Consequently, there is no need to build a retaining wall or the like around the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> before it is placed in the hole. However, if the appearance of an in-ground spa is desired, and the user wishes to keep the option to move the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the future, such a conventional retaining wall could be built. Advantageously, since the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is accessible at the tope of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, only a small clearance is necessary between the spa side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the retaining wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed above-ground level, there will be some lateral forces against the walls comprising the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, the weight of the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> creates an outward lateral pressure against the reservoir walls and contributes to the overall weight of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and thus the forces exerted on the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supporting the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Even more significant, however, is the lateral pressure against the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> caused by the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed directly in the ground. If the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is empty for a significant time, this lateral inward pressure could cause substantial damage or buckling of the walls without a counteracting support system. Accordingly, the present invention provides a reinforcing means to prevent this damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a reinforcing means comprising an internal support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which provides the necessary structural support to enable the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to resist the subjacent lateral forces of the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resulting from in-ground installation. The support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of supports such as pressure treated wood. Other suitable supports, such as supports made from rigid plastic material, also can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is located in the space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and comprises bottom horizontal supports <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, top horizontal supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and vertical supports <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending between and connecting the top supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the bottom supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Triangulation of the vertical supports <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is accomplished by braces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having one end connected either to a vertical support <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or a top horizontal support <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and having another end connected to a corresponding horizontal bottom support <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A dense foam or similar lightweight, high-strength material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, discussed above, may also be used as a filler between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to increase the structural integrity as well as the insulation capacity of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, it is contemplated that an appropriate filler <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the requisite structural strength and other characteristics could be used alone to support the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, without requiring the support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are accessible from the side of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a side access door <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A side shield <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> isolates and protects the side access door <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from the surrounding earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for an in-ground installation. However, the excavated ground otherwise completely surrounds and abuts against the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as in the in-ground installation discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a universal self-contained spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that can be installed either above ground or below ground level, while still providing a means to access the equipment necessary to service the spa. Access to the equipment is both convenient and safe, and the overall appearance of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its surrounding environment is as aesthetically pleasing as possible. The resulting spa is extremely versatile, as it may be portable or permanently installed at the option of the owner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> While a particular form of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to collapsible furniture, and more particularly to bedding which may be used for temporary purposes such as for overnight guests. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Temporary beds have been used for many years and come in many forms, from a simple futon or air mattress to more complex &ldquo;hide-a-bed&rdquo; style devices. Such temporary beds are most often used when guests, either expected or otherwise, stay overnight. In such cases, it is desirable that the temporary bed be quick and easy to assemble, comfortable, and collapse to a small configuration which can be easily and conveniently stored in a closet or storage cabinet. An air mattress has the advantage of deflating to a very compact size when the internal air pressure is released, and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. The air pressure in the mattress gives good support to body members and the air can redistribute within the mattress slightly in response to greater weight loads in certain areas. It can thus conform to the user&apos;s body, is lightweight, and is generally easily portable, even when inflated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, those who go camping out of trailers, etc. may wish to sleep out-of-doors, but may wish to isolate themselves from insects, snakes and other forest denizens which may roam the forest floor. For such purposes, an elevated bed, which is easily collapsible and portable, may be very useful. It also may be useful in rocky terrain, or in areas of thorns or burrs, which would otherwise contact the air mattress and possibly puncture it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the less effort involved in constructing the bed, the more desirable the typical user would consider the bed to be. People who are contemplating retiring to bed are often already in a state of fatigue or unsteadiness in which the construction of a bed from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration may seem a daunting prospect. Therefore, a bed structure which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting, would be very desirable in a variety of situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed which is elevated from contact with the ground or floor, and which is both very portable and comfortable for the user. There is also a need for a bed which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There have been many variations adjustable beds which are designed so that the bed or a portion of it can incline. Such an inclining bed allows the user, who may be bed-ridden, or merely relaxing, to assume a sitting position for reading, watching television, etc. Inclining beds have been used in hospitals for many years, and are the subject of numerous U.S. patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,784, U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,486, U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,732, U.S. Pat. No. 4,025,972, U.S. Pat. No. 3,974,530, U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,393, U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,946, U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,528, U.S. Pat. No. 6,276,011 and others. These beds are generally bulky and often included motor-powered apparatus to achieve the inclination. There have a been a few attempts to use air pressure to change the inclination of the mattress, such as are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,522, U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,731 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,044. These beds too are generally bulky and designed for stationary use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Collapsible beds are increasingly popular with the public as a way of providing easy and elegant bedding for visitors or for those with limited floor-space who appreciate having a bed that can be removed from use when not needed. Air-mattress beds are a convenient variation on this, as the volume of the bed is easily reduced merely by venting the internal air. However, as discussed above, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, it is desirable to have a frame which is collapsible under a mattress which is also preferably collapsible. However, applicant is unaware of any mechanism which allows the bed or frame of a collapsible frame to incline. Thus, a user of this style bed would need to position the bed adjacent to a wall and brace the feet from sliding in order to be able to sit up in bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed and bed frame which can incline to allow comfortable sitting by the user. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a collapsible bed which collapses to a compact configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a bed which inclines to allow the user to sit at an upright angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> And another object of the invention is to provide an inclining bed frame which can be used with a variety of mattresses. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an air bed with a support structure. As illustrated in the various drawings herein, and particularly in the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> form of this preferred embodiment of the inventive device is depicted by the general reference character <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrates an air bed with an elevated support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having generally an air bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes generally a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having an entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is sealed with a closure fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but which is also possibly any conventional device such as Velcro, hook-and-eye fasteners, etc. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be plastic, cloth, leather, etc. and encloses at least a portion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, either before or after inflation. The zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then closed to complete the installation of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be removed as desired through the same entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, again, either before or after the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deflated. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a number of cells <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and at least one inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through which air is introduced to inflate the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not completely enclose the entire air mattress, but may enclose only a portion or portions such as the ends or sides of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 21</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> shows the articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined at the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be spoken of as &ldquo;expanding outwardly from a central area&rdquo;, although it is to be understood that one of the feet may actually remain in fixed position, while the remainder of the feet move outward. In other words, the central reference area from which the feet move, may itself move laterally. One example of this occurs when the collapsed support frame is placed in the corner of a room, where, say, the left rear foot of the frame is in the left rear corner of the room, and thus is constrained from movement in a further leftward or rearward direction. When the frame expands, all the other, non-constrained feet will expand outwardly from a central area to the right, or forward, or both, even as the central area itself will move to the right and forward, relative to the immobile left rear foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that all the lines of direction of the movement of the feet are not expected to intersect at a precise point. The central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is thus a relatively small region from which the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> move outwardly, but there should be no inference that all feet must move in a specific lines, such as radially from a single specific center point. To one skilled in the art, it will be apparent that if such precise directionality were attempted, manufacturing errors would inevitably introduce variations. Thus, the expansion is considered to move outwardly from a central area or region, and should not be construed to imply any particular lines of direction, other than generally outward from this central area. The direction arrows and central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> below, are therefore not provided to show specific lines of movement which must be followed, but merely a general direction of movement towards, or away from, a general central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The articulated frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also optionally includes support webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which may have hooks (not shown) which anchor the support webbing to the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may also have attachment points (not shown) for securing the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show closer views of the assembled air bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which several of the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are selected for detail views in detail circles A-F. The pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are made to receive 4 connections and thus will be called four-pivot connectors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These are preferably reversible, so that the same four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be used as a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and as an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus making for uniformity, and ease of manufacturing. The frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> too are preferably interchangeable and of uniform length, with the exception of the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which are positioned in each of the four corners. These are composed of two or more corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may slide within each other in order to extend or contract in length. This is desirable because when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in collapsed position, the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be of greater length than when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is expanded. In the expanded position therefore, one of the corner members will preferably slide within the other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>

Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle E of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, thus the assembly sequence allows for the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be placed upright, expanded, the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closed, and the bed is ready to receive bed clothes, or be otherwise used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A useful variation on this invention is an air-bed with a self-expanding support structure. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The structure and elements are much the same, and when elements correspond to those used previously, the same element numbers will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The air-bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, either directly, or preferably through a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment may be permanent or removable, by such conventional means as buttons, snaps, Velcro&reg;, etc., but it is important that the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as it expands, is attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged to move with the expansion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. There is a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described previously, which may also be the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which protects the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from damage at points where it is rubbed against the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while inflating or deflating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> An air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to an inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically operated, and can be powered either by wall current or by batteries. If batteries are used, they may be included in a battery pack (not shown). The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which can be operated by a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means from a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means is preferably cordless, such as radio or infra-red diode laser beam, etc. The remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has an on-off button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which activates and deactivates the electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is by no means a necessity, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for back-up operation if the remote <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is misplaced or the remote&apos;s batteries are low, or if the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed not to be operated by remote control at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the direction arrows <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or it may be removable in order to allow access to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by either a hand pump or by mouth in case electrical power is unavailable for the electrical pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or if it breaks down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has been attached to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a detail view of the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been removed. Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into which the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been seated. This recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to fit smoothly without extending far beyond the perimeter of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus protecting it from being bumped or knocked away from its position at the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be maintained in position after the inflation is complete. Of course, the use of a recess area is optional and should not be considered as a limitation. Also, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made to be routinely removed after operation. In this case a self-sealing valve (not shown) is provided for the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is also shown, which is preferably included even when the pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is expected to be operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature is a secondary inflation port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be used for attachment of a manual air pump or for inflation by lung power. This may be a conventional air valve as generally used in air mattresses. It may also be used as a venting port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for allowing air pressure out of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is to be maintained in position, perhaps permanently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention uses an air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is removable. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably fitting with a friction lock (not visible) similar to those used to attach lens to cameras, and which forms an airtight seal between the two parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also preferably contains a pressure sensor or self-regulator (not visible) which detects or acts when the air pressure in the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has reached a predetermined level, and which then shuts off the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is also not a required feature and should not be construed as a limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the electrical air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be operated from batteries, perhaps from a battery pack. The bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is thus usable in the outdoors or in a cabin which is not equipped with power lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> This style of frame structure, which is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has many advantages, as it is constructed of a number of cross-members which are attached to each other at pivots, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies in the feet and upper connector assemblies. As discussed above, these pivot assemblies and pivots connect all the frame members to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs are joined at the pivot assemblies. They also allow the frame as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. However, applicant is unaware of any mechanism which allows the bed or frame of a collapsible frame to incline. Thus, a user of this style bed would need to position the bed adjacent to a wall and brace the feet from sliding in order to be able to sit up in bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An additional embodiment has been designed to address this problem by allowing a portion of the frame to incline. This embodiment of the present invention is an inclining collapsible bed, which is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and will be designated by the reference number <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Where elements are similar to those described with reference to the first embodiment, the same reference numbers will be used. Elements which are peculiar to this additional embodiment will generally be referred to by a three digit reference number prefaced by a &ldquo;2&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a front perspective view of the present inclining bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> with the bed in fully reclining position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a front perspective view of the bed in inclining position <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is shown in a close-up view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The angle-retention mechanism <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and also in an exploded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the support frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> supports a mattress <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which can be an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but may also be any number of conventional mattresses or futons, as long as they are flexible or have a hinge in the region where the angle of incline begins. The frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is again preferably composed of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are configured in scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which are in turn configured in an extended scissor frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as described above. The frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes an inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which includes inclining support members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, preferably telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, having an inner pole <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and an outer pole <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> especially), and an angle retention mechanism <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a clamp or adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Three adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are shown in the figure, preferably one for each line of frame members included. The end-most scissor pair <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the extended scissor frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a upward angled member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> which connects to the upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the head-end corner of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and an downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, which connects to the corner foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For this discussion, upward and downward angled are taken with respect to the foot of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> moving towards the head of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The upward and downward angled members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be identical to the other scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the exception of having a pivot hole for connection of the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and having retention notches, to be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the upward angled members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> by pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and downward angled members <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> pass through holes in the adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown especially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, as the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is inclined, the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> pivots at its attachment with the upward angled member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. As it does so, the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> moves upward and towards the rear of the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and also moves upward on the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> in closer detail, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> show the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in perspective and exploded views respectively. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> includes a housing cavity <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, housing groove <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and housing through-hole <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, through which downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> passes and is allowed to slide unless stopped by a retention notch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. A release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> having an end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, is pivotally attached to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is biased by spring <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> to engage the retention notches <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> until forced away from engagement by pressing on the end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> of the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is attached to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> by a pivot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which passes through the bracket pivot hole <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a set of bracket through-holes <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through which the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> passes. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is allowed to slide freely along the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and the angle of the pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> relative to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is also allowed to rotate freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> first retention notch <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> and a second retention notch <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> are shown. When the frame is in reclining position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> may engage the first retention hole <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in order to give the bed stability in its reclining position. To incline the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is released by pressing the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. The adjuster clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is then free to slide along the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and telescoping member <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> as the inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> raises. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is allowed to pivot relative to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as the adjuster clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> moves. The adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> moves along the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> until the tip of the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> reaches the second retention notch <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, which the spring <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> again engages to maintain the frame in an inclined angle until released by the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The mattress <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> will preferably have a fabric covering <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, to which portions of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are attached, including the ends of the inner poles <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> so that they are drawn to telescope outward when the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is inclined, and are pushed back inward when the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is to be reclined. This fabric covering <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and its attachment to portions of various frame members also allow the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to be self-expanding in response to inflation of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as described above in reference to the previous embodiments. Also as described above, an air-pump, which may be remote controlled, may be used to inflate the air mattress, and a pressure-sensing valve may be used to turn off the pump when the appropriate pressure is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although two retention notches are shown in the preferred embodiment, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that there could be more than two retention notches to allow intermediate angles of inclination between an upright position and reclining position. It is also possible that the fully reclining position can be maintained by allowing the mattress to lie on the upper connector assemblies so that a retention notch is not required, thus there may only a single retention notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It will also be obvious to one skilled in the art that many variations in the angle retention mechanism or adjustable clip mechanism are possible. As only one possible variation, instead of retention notches and pins, the angle of inclination can be established by the turning of a screw or wing nut, which compresses halves of a split-housing on the frame members., It is also possible that the clamp mechanism might be applied to the outer poles <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are shown being applied to three parallel frame members. It is of course possible that the frame, and the bed supported by it, be of different widths than that shown by the figures, and may use greater or fewer parallel frame members, so that there may be two parallel rows, or four or more rows, used in single width beds or king-sized beds respectively. Of three or four parallel rows, clips or clamps may be applied to fewer than all parallel rows, such as only the outer rows, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not, limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> present an easy and attractive way of providing bedding for overnight guests or visitors. The articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and at pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at multiple points, either directly, or by being at least partially enclosed by a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is, in turn, attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and inflated, either by the user&apos;s lung power or by activation of an electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the preferred air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, it is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses laterally on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by which the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be elevated to allow the user to sit up in bed. Such an inclining bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allows the user, who may be bed-ridden, or merely relaxing, to assume a sitting position for reading, watching television, etc. This provides many advantages for dwellers in small apartments or otherwise limited floor space so that the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may serve as a lounger or a sort of sofa when desired, while still allowing the bed to be folded to a compact bundle for storage. As with the other embodiments, the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can be attached to the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at multiple points and thus expand it automatically as the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will find much application in user&apos;s homes, in commercial travel lodges, such as hotels, etc. where an extra bed may be needed, and may also find use in business offices to replace the occasional folding cot presently used by workaholics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For the above, and other, reasons, it is expected that the air bed with elevated and self-expanding support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention will have widespread industrial applicability. Therefore, it is expected that the commercial utility of the present invention will be extensive and long lasting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to bed siderails, and, more particularly, to bed siderails with flexible portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds often have siderails to reduce the likelihood that convalescing patients will inadvertently fall out of their beds. The siderails are usually constructed from metal or a similarly rigid material such as a stiff plastic or polymer, and may be raised and lowered vertically to accommodate a patient moving into and out of the hospital bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds also often have a head section of the bed that may be pivoted upwardly about a transverse pivot axis to allow the patient to move to a sitting position. It is desirable to simultaneously pivot the siderails adjacent to the head section of the bed upwardly with the head section of the bed. To accommodate raising the siderails in this manner, the siderails are typically divided into two sections, a head section and a body section. The head section and body section siderails must be spaced apart at the transverse pivot axis to allow the head section siderail to pivot without impinging the stationary body section siderail. Therefore, a gap is created between the head section siderail and the body section siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a bed siderail of unitary construction which eliminates the gap between conventional siderails. The bed siderail of the present invention includes a flexible portion to allow a portion of the siderail adjacent the head section of the bed to pivot upwardly with the head section of the bed, while body section of the siderail remains substantially stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed having a frame and a head deck section coupled to the frame. The head deck section is movable relative to the frame from a generally horizontal position to an elevated position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the head deck section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its elevated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, the flexible member bends in a second direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its generally horizontal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, a lifting mechanism is coupled to the frame and to the second end portion of the flexible member. The lifting mechanism is configured to raise and lower the flexible member relative to the frame. A locking mechanism is illustratively coupled to the lifting mechanism and a release handle coupled to the locking mechanism. Actuation of the release handle releases the locking mechanism and permits movement of the lifting mechanism and the flexible member relative to the frame. The illustrated embodiment also includes an extendible section located along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member and capable of extending and retracting along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed including a patient support surface having opposite first and second sides, a head end, and a foot end spaced apart from the head end to define a length dimension of the patient support surface therebetween. The siderail includes first and second elongated flexible members coupled to the bed and extending along the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second flexible members illustratively extend for at least fifty percent of the length dimension of the patient support surface. The siderail also includes first and second lifting mechanisms coupled to the bed adjacent the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second lifting mechanisms also are coupled to the first and second flexible members, respectively, to raise and lower the first and second flexible members relative to the patient support surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another illustrated embodiment of the invention includes a siderail for a bed having a frame and an elevating section coupled to the frame, the elevating section having a raised position and a lowered position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the elevating section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the elevating section is in its raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another illustrative embodiment of the invention includes a siderail covering for a bed siderail having flexible portions and extendible portions. The siderail covering includes a material configured to flex along the flexible portion of the bed siderail and compress along the extendible portion of the bed siderail. The material including a plurality of compressible regions, and defines an central aperture configured to receive the bed siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also according to the invention, the siderail covering material further defines a seam extending from the outer surface of the siderail cover to the central aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Additional features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiment exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application claims the priority benefits of Taiwan patent application entitled &ldquo;Pressure Adjustable Pillow&rdquo; filed on May 17, 2002 serial number 91207131. All disclosures of this application are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a pressure adjustable pillow, and more particularly pertains to a pillow, which allows a user to adjust the support of different portions of the pillow as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A great many kinds of pillows have been devised since ancient time, such as cotton pillow, tea leaves pillow, sponge pillow and latex pillow. Nonetheless, those pillows seem to provide similar pressure and height of head support for various users, despite the fact that different users have different head shapes and sleep preferences. It is undisputable that prior art pillows as mentioned above are not flexible enough to fit the head shapes and meet the sleep preferences of users. Also, prior pillows are not tailor made to meet individual needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a prior art pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. The pillow contains soft materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is rectangular. When a user lies on the pillow, the contact surface can be divided into three sections. An area from the user&apos;s shoulder to the lower part of ears is defined as a bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an area from the lower part of ears to the upper part of ears is defined as a middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the an area from the upper part of ears to the top of the head is defined as a top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When a user lies face up as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the part of the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a head provides the major support for the head, and as a result the corresponding part of the pillow is more recessed. On the other hand, the parts of the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> only partially contact the head. Based on the facts, it is concluded that the support provided by the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mainly relies on the contact area between the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the corresponding part of the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The support provided by such small contact area is insufficient and often users may find such pillows are uncomfortable to sleep on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When a user sleeps on user&apos;s side as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is noted that the part of the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a head provides the better support for the head. The pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> then becomes more recessed as a result of extra contact area of ears comparing to the status in face-up position. But it also means that the support force provided by the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also apply on ears, and squeeze the ears. Moreover, when a user sleeps on user&apos;s side, the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is even more far away from the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Under the circumstance, the neck of the user will be completely without any support from the pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the user may find the pillow uncomfortable to sleep on. Diffusion users have different head shapes. Prior art pillow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can not meet specific needs derived from various kinds of head shapes, and consequentially fails to serve as an sleep aid to users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, refer to the other kind of prior art pillow <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> made of latex as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pillow <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be divided into three parts based on the aforementioned three sections of a head. Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it shows that parts of the pillow <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> corresponding to the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are elevated, and the part of the pillow <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> corresponding to the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is recessed. Although latex pillow provides adapts to various head shapes much better than other prior pillows, it is not suited for providing micro level adjustment for individual users. User&apos;s specific requirements for pillows remain unmet. Similar circumstances may occur to standardized ready-to-wear clothes. Since sizes are determined by manufacturer&apos;s market study, it is often that waist fit size clothes may fail to meet the desired length of users. For users with specific requirements for clothes, tailors provide solutions to meet their request. However, for users with specific requirements for pillows, the issue becomes more complicated. Because each person&apos;s head shape changes with time, and sleep preferences also varies according to habits, mood and body conditions, a pillow designed for individual needs is therefore desirable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is to provide a pressure adjustable pillow which allow users to adjust the pressure received by the head from the pillow to meet different needs derived from different head shapes and sleep habits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another objective of the present invention is to provide a pillow which allow users to adjust the pressure received by the head from the pillow to meet different individual pillow preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a pressure adjustable pillow, which has pressure indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to realize the objectives above, a pressure adjustable pillow according to the present invention is provided. The pressure adjustable pillow comprises a chamber made of an impermeable material and a cover member. The chamber is defined by a first direction, wherein the internal portion contains fluids. The chamber has a first area, second area and an intermediate area between the first and the second area. Three areas are disposed to each other along the direction perpendicular to the first direction. Each area is not connected. Each area has three sealed and not linked sacs along the first direction. Each sac has a valve. The valve is used for injecting or releasing fluids in corresponding sacs when required. When injecting fluids, an injection member is required for fluids injecting. When releasing fluids, the valve is probed open to form an outlet. The cover member encloses the chamber. The cover member may completely or partially encloses the chamber.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has a chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is made of impermeable materials such as PVC. The chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is defined by a first direction <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be injected with fluids such as air or water, while it is air injected in the pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment. The chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a first area <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a second area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an intermediate area <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> between the first area <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the second area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Each area is not connected. Three areas are disposed to each other along the direction perpendicular to the first direction <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Each area <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> contains three sealed sacs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> along the first direction <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each sac <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> has a valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Each valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can be disposed on the same side of the chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Pipes can be used to couple the valve to the sacs, or the valve may be disposed on the top of each sac. The linking method is obvious to persons skilled in the art and as a result not repeated in the text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is divided into three areas <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> corresponding to different sleep postures such as on users&apos; side, in face-up position etc. Each area <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is installed with three sacs, corresponding to three parts of a head. An area from the user&apos;s shoulder to the lower part of ears is defined as a bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an area from the lower part of ears to the upper part of ears is defined as a middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the an area from the upper part of ears to the top of the head is defined as a top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Further details of the implementation will be provided in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Sacs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are arranged in the shape of a rectangle. There are three sacs formed on each side of the pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is a check valve. The valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> has a valve member <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. A tool probing against the valve member <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> is required to open the check valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. If valve member <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> is not probed open, the air pressure from corresponding sacs keeps the check valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in closed state. Detailed operation steps will be given in the following. According to the embodiment, a cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> encloses the chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is made of latex. The cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has an undulated upper surface <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight>. The cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be configured to enclose the chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> completely, or enclose the chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> partially as long as it covers the contact surface between user&apos;s head and the pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is to provide a soft support layer between user&apos;s head and the chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an injection member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is incorporated in the embodiment. In the embodiment, air is selected as the fluids injected. Therefore, the injection member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a pump. The injection member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> made of elastic materials has a squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is shaped like an ellipsoid. There is a temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> inside of the squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has an inlet <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>. The inlet <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> is a check valve, which only permits air to flow into the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The air cannot flow out of the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the inlet <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>. Temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has an outlet <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>. The outlet <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> is also a check valve, which only permits air to flow out of the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The air cannot flow into the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the outlet <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>. There is a pipe <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> at the conjunction part of the outlet <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>. The pipe <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is capable of probing into each valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to open the valve member <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> for opening the valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. When a user squeezes the squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the air in the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> then flow into a sac corresponding to the valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. When the user releases the squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the external air then flow into the temporary gas sac <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the inlet <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>. By repeating steps of squeezing and releasing the squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the air is injected into corresponding sacs. By doing so, users are allowed to proceed to the air injection operation easily and efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is a gas pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>&prime; linked between the squeeze portion <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; and the pipe <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a pressure indicator <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>&prime; installed on the top of the gas pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>&prime;. The design is provided for keep users being aware of the pressure in the sacs and allow users to decide whether to stop the air injection or release the air from the sacs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when air injection is completed in a sac, the pipe <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, at the same time the valve member <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> then is pushed by the pressure in the sac and close the valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Further details of the above operation are also obvious to ones skilled in the art and are omitted in the text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when a user lies face up, the user&apos;s head lies against the intermediate area <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the head correspond respectively to the sacs <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Under the circumstance, the user may inject less air in the sac <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and inject more air into the sacs <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the user lies on the pillow <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the sacs <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> then have higher air pressure than the sac <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and keep the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> elevated. In addition, such configuration provides sufficient support force for the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because the sac <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is injected with less air than the sacs <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is kept lower, and does not provide excess support over the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when a user sleeps on user&apos;s side either on the left or right, assuming the using sleeps on user&apos;s side on the right, then the head lies on the first area <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the head correspond respectively to the sacs <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Under the circumstance, the user may inject less air in the sac <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and inject more air into the sacs <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the user sleeps on user&apos;s side, the sacs <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> then have higher air pressure than the sac <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and keep the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> elevated. In addition, such configuration provides sufficient support force for the bottom section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the top section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because the sac <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is injected with less air than the sacs <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the cover member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is kept lower, and does not provide excess support over the middle section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the head. By providing the configuration above, the user&apos;s ear is allowed to position properly without being squeezed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a user is provided with a pillow giving sufficient and appropriate support, so as to allow the user to have a more comfortable sleep. Users are able to adjust the pressure of a pillow configured according to the present invention based on specific needs by adjusting the air amount in the sacs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Because the air amount injected in the sacs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> completely depends on user&apos;s requirements, thus the present invention is applicable to various users. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for treating a mixture containing cellulose, comprising at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups. The invention further relates to a specialty cellulose pulp, obtained by a method comprising said treatment. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of the specialty cellulose pulp according to the invention or the specialty cellulose pulp obtained by a method according to the invention for the production of cellulose derivatives or materials containing cellulose molecules as a raw material, including but not limited to, cellulose ethers or cellulose esters. Cellulose derivatives obtained from the specialty cellulose pulp according to the invention display increased viscosity and/or improved brightness over cellulose derivatives obtained from specialty cellulose pulp not subjected to the inventive treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Although the method according to the invention can be employed for any mixture containing cellulose, by way of example, the treatment of mixtures containing cellulose leading to specialty cellulose pulp is used to illustrate the particular embodiments. However, this shall not be construed to mean that the method as claimed is only applicable to specialty cellulose pulp. For the purpose of the present invention, wherever applicable, the term &ldquo;specialty cellulose pulp&rdquo; is synonymous to the general term &ldquo;pulp&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Specialty cellulose pulp is used to manufacture a number of products that require physical and chemical properties not provided by the pulp used for the manufacture of standard paper, linerboard or cardboard. Specialty cellulose pulp therefore differs from the major portion of cellulose pulp produced in the world today. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Any treatment that a mixture containing cellulose is subjected to, in particular if it is to be used as specialty cellulose pulp, has to be performed as to maintain the properties important to the end use, in particular the integrity of the cellulose molecules themselves. One of the most important steps of treatment of a mixture containing cellulose, typically obtained from pulping wood, is a step of bleaching, or, in most applications, a multi-stage bleaching process. Bleaching is commonly achieved by treating a pulp slurry with chemicals that either remove colored compounds such as lignin, or alter the structure of colored compounds so that they are no longer colored. The extent to which a specialty cellulose is bleached depends on the requirements for the end-product manufactured from the specialty cellulose pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The expert in the field typically understands a bleaching process as one that increases the ISO brightness of a mixture containing cellulose. Futhermore, the expert in the field typically understands that bleaching is achieved primarily by oxidation processes, i.e. bleaching of any mixture containing cellulose according to the prior art typically involves the application of an oxidizing agent. For environmental reasons, common elemental chlorine bleaching using chlorine and/or hypochlorite is successively replaced by elemental chlorine free bleaching (ECF) processes, wherein chlorine dioxide replaces chlorine and/or hypochlorite. Totally chlorine free (TCF) bleaching uses chlorine-free bleaching agents such as oxygen or peroxides. A method for the non-chlorine bleaching of cellulose pulp using oxygen gas in sophisticated treatment stages is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,782. Other oxidizing agents are ozone or enzymes. JP-A 0 6 033 390 for example discloses a method for using ozone to bleach pulp. A main concern is to limit the oxidizing agent exposure time in order to limit damage to the cellulose molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In summary, bleaching techniques known to the expert in the field typically involve oxidizing agents. The degree of ISO brightness achievable by these methods of bleaching is limited to the extent that strong oxidizing agents (or highly concentrated oxidizing agents) which would result in a high degree of ISO brightness also tend to damage the cellulose molecules. In particular, strong or highly concentrated oxidizing agents tend to reduce the degree of polymerization (DP) of the cellulose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A process known as &ldquo;reductive bleaching&rdquo; is used commonly for brightening virgin mechanical pulps or pulp from recycled newsprint. In this process, a reducing agent, typically sodium borohydride, is used to generate sodium hydrosulfite in situ from primary chemicals, i.e. the reducing agent is not used to reduce carbonyl-groups in the pulp but to generate a bleaching agent. This process is disclosed, e.g. on pages 502 through 504 of &ldquo;Pulp Bleaching; Principles and Practice&rdquo;, Dence and Reeve (Eds.), TAPPI Press, 1996. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of reducing agents is also known in the context of late stages of the treatment of cellulose pulps. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,711 discloses the use of borohydrides to treat cellulose fabric that already had been subjected to a bleaching treatment. Here, the application of reducing agents improves the dyeability of said cellulosic fibers. The U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,621 relates to stripping textile fibers, including cellulose acetates and other products obtained from specialty cellulose pulp, of their dyes by using reducing agents such as borohydrides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another process involving the use of reducing agents in the context of the treatment of cellulose pulp is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,772. Said process involves treating a cellulose pulp that bad already been bleached with one or more reducing agents in order to reduce carbonyl groups on the lignin contained in the cellulose pulp. The process includes adding a complexing agent together with the reducing agent and processing the mixture at a temperature not greater than 40&deg; C. This treatment is followed by at least one further step: either a treatment with a chemical that will block the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the lignin and/or a treatment to convert short-wave light quanta to long wave light quanta. The object of the process according to the U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,772 is to prevent the yellowing with age of lignin contained in (high yield) cellulose pulps. The process is to be used with ground-wood pulp, refiner pulp, thermo-mechanical and chemical-mechanical pulp for paper manufacture. Therefore, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,772 does not relate at all to the treatment of specialty cellulose pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Finally, the possible use of borohydrides has been discussed in &ldquo;Pulp Bleaching; Principles and Practice&rdquo;, Dence and Reeve (Eds.), TAPPI Press, 1996, pages 297, wherein a borohydride is mentioned as a possible additive to eliminate some of the loss in strength of paper induced by the alkaline extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention was to provide a method of treating a mixture containing cellulose, preferably a mixture containing cellulose leading to specialty cellulose pulp, so that the degree of brightness or the viscosity of cellulose derivatives obtained therefrom, or both, is/are increased over the prior art. In addition, as a result, a specialty cellulose pulp as such, leading to cellulose derivatives with increased viscosity and/or brightness was to be provided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, it was found that this object could be achieved by treating a mixture containing cellulose with at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups. This treatment can be performed at any stage of processing a mixture containing cellulose into specialty cellulose pulp once a mixture containing cellulose has been obtained from (i) chemically pulping wood (&equals;&ldquo;cooking&rdquo;), (ii) chemically and mechanically pulping wood or (iii) unpulped cotton or (iv) any combination of (i) to (iii). The inventive treatment is either the sole step of the entire process or is performed prior to bleaching and/or after bleaching or is performed as at least one step of a multi-stage bleaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The solution according to the invention is particularly surprising since the prior art does not teach that treating a mixture containing cellulose, i.e. treating a pulp, leads to cellulose derivatives obtainable from the treated pulp with improved viscosity and/or brightness in comparison to a similar cellulose derivative obtained by the same process but excluding the inventive step of adding at least on agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore relates to a method for treating a mixture containing cellulose, comprising at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups. The invention further relates to a specialty cellulose pulp, obtained by a method comprising said treatment. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of the specialty cellulose pulp according to the invention or the specialty cellulose pulp obtained by a method according to the invention for the production of cellulose derivatives or materials containing cellulose molecules as a raw material, including but not limited to, cellulose ethers or cellulose esters. Cellulose derivatives obtained from the specialty cellulose pulp according to the invention display increased viscosity and/or improved brightness over cellulose derivatives obtained from specialty cellulose pulp not subjected to the inventive treatment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;mixture containing cellulose&rdquo; according to the invention is any mixture that contains the glucose polymer of cellulose. No principal limitations exist as to the state of the cellulose source, i.e. it may be solid, liquid, a suspension, slurry, paste or powder. Furthermore, no limits exist as to the origin of the cellulose. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture containing cellulose is derived from cotton linters and/or wood. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the mixture containing cellulose is derived from wood. Other cellulose sources, in particular annual plants and/or biomass, (micro)biologically produced and/or derived cellulose, or cellulose from all types of cell walls are included as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, no limitations exist with respect to the degree of polymerization of the mixture containing cellulose, as well as of any product, such as specialty cellulose pulp and/or derivatives thereof, obtained from said mixture containing cellulose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the mixture containing cellulose may be derived from raw materials that need to be pulped. In general, the term &ldquo;pulping&rdquo; refers to any process that separates the cellulose from the at least one component that holds the cellulose together in the raw material. For example, in wood, the cellulose is held together by lignin and hemicellulose in fibers. The pulping process is meant to separate, at least partly, the lignin from the carbohydrate moieties of these fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As to pulping processes, three different methods are commonly discerned: (i) chemical pulping (or &ldquo;cooking&rdquo;), (ii) mechanical (or &ldquo;groundwood&rdquo;) pulping and (iii) semi-chemical or chemical-mechanical pulping. In (i), the raw material, typically wood, is cooked in a &ldquo;digester&rdquo; at elevated temperatures with chemicals suited to break the bonds between the cellulose molecules and the lignin. In (ii), the raw material is typically pressed against a grinder which physically separates the fibers. The process (iii) refers to any combination of (i) and (ii). In the context of the present invention, no principal limitations exist as to how the pulping is to be performed, so long as the pulping results in a mixture containing cellulose that can be subjected to the treatment according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Pulping&rdquo; may not be necessary for all raw materials. For example, if cotton linters are used as the mixture containing cellulose, no chemical or mechanical pulping is necessary prior to any subsequent treatment, including the inventive treatment and/or bleaching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A mixture containing cellulose that has been pulped as described above, is commonly referred to as &ldquo;pulp&rdquo;. In the context of the present invention, the term &ldquo;pulp&rdquo; is to be seen as more general than the term &ldquo;mixture containing cellulose&rdquo;, since the term &ldquo;pulp&rdquo; is meant to refer to the mixture containing cellulose before the inventive treatment as well as to the treated mixture, for example the specialty cellulose pulp as obtained after the inventive treatment. By contrast, the term &ldquo;mixture containing cellulose&rdquo; is only meant to describe the pulp before the treatment according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although the inventive method of treating a mixture containing cellulose with the objective to obtain specialty cellulose pulp can be, in principle, performed with any mixture containing cellulose, the method according to the invention is particularly effective, and therefore preferred, when applied to a mixture containing cellulose derived from wood. It is further preferred to pulp the wood chemically prior to the inventive treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As far as wood as a source for the mixture containing cellulose is concerned, both hardwood and softwood tree species may be used. Examples of softwoods include but are not limited to: pines, in particular Southern pine, White pine, Caribbean pine; Western hemlock; spruces, in particular Norway Spruce, Sitka Spruce; Douglas fir or the like. Examples of hardwoods include, but are not limited to: gum, maple, oak, eucalyptus, poplar, beech, or aspen. Mixtures of two or more types of soft and/or hard wood are included as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Prior to the at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups and/or prior and/or during and/or after any step of pulping, the mixture containing cellulose may be optionally subjected to any type of pretreatment. Such types of pretreatment include but are not limited to enzyme treatments, mechanical refining, addition of additives, addition of complexing agents, treatment with delignification and other catalysts, the removal of fines as well as any combination of the aforementioned steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After the mixture containing cellulose has been prepared and/or obtained and/or pretreated and/or treated with at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups (i.e. the inventive treatment), the mixture may be subjected to a bleaching process. The term &ldquo;bleaching&rdquo; as used in the context of the present invention refers to any treatment of the mixture containing cellulose in which the degree of brightness after the bleaching is increased over the degree of brightness before bleaching. The term &ldquo;ISO brightness&rdquo; as used in the context of the present invention is defined in &ldquo;ISO 2470-1999&mdash;paper, boards and pulp&mdash;measurements of the diffuse blue reflectance factor (ISO brightness)&rdquo; and refers to the brightness of the pulp. It is important to discriminate this term from the term &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; as used in the context of the present invention, which refers to the brightness of the end product, i.e. the derivative of the specialty cellulose pulp. A standard for measuring said brightness according to the invention is given in Example 6. In principle, bleaching can be performed with any agent capable of achieving the above mentioned objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At at least one stage of the processing of the mixture containing cellulose, obtained after pulping as has been described above, at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups (&equals;reducing agent) is added to the mixture containing cellulose. As a reducing agent in the context of the present invention, every compound or mixture of compounds can be used that results in at least the partial reduction of at least a part of the carbonyl groups in at least one of the components contained within the pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Carbonyl groups form a part of the molecular structure of the main compounds in any mixture containing cellulose. As compounds are to be named, by way of example, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and resins. The carbonyl groups according to the invention that are, at least partially, reduced in the inventive step of adding a reducing agent, may either be naturally present in the raw-material structures or may be generated during processing or both. This is particularly true of the mixtures containing cellulose used for the manufacture of specialty cellulose pulps derived from wood but is also the case, to a lesser extent, for pulp derived from other raw materials, such as pulp derived from cotton linters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In principle, any agent that at least partially reduces at least a part of the carbonyl-groups present in the mixture containing cellulose can be used. Borohydrides are particularly preferred, while water-compatible borohydride salts are further preferred. Such salts include but are not limited to sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium trimethoxyborohydride, tetramethylammonium borohydride, tetramethylammonium triacetoxyborohydride, tetraethylammonium borohydride, tetrabutylammonium borohydride, tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride, cetyltrimethylammonium borohydride, benzyltriethylammonium borohydride, Bis(triphenyl-phosphine) copper (1) borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, dimethylamineborane (DMAB) and mixtures of at least two of these. Preferably, said reducing agents used should be water-soluble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The reducing agent can be used by itself, in combination with other reducing agents and/or in combination with stabilizers such as calcium hydroxide, magnesium bicarbonate or other mildly basic salts. Further additional substances with other purposes may be added as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The reducing agents and/or additional substances may be added as a solid, a powder, a dispersion, suspension, emulsion or as a solution in a preferred embodiment, if borohydrides are used, they are used in powder form or in the form of a standard solution, e.g. sodium borohydride, which can be purchased as a 12 wt % solution in 40 wt % aqueous sodium hydroxide (e.g. Borol&reg; from Rohm and Haas, Hydrafin&trade; from Finnish Chemicals (Nokia) Ltd). All commercially available forms of these chemicals, as well as any chemical of this kind prepared in a laboratory, may be used to carry out the treatment of a mixture containing cellulose as disclosed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As has been mentioned above, the reducing agent may be added at any stage of the processing of the mixture containing cellulose. In a preferred embodiment, the reducing agent is added in at least one step during a multi-stage bleaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the at least one reducing agent is added, i.e. the inventive treatment is performed, at least as the last stage or after the last stage of a multi-stage bleaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The content of reducing agent added in at least one step may vary from 0.01 to 500 g, preferably from 0.1 g&middot;mol/ton mixture containing cellulose (dry basis) to 2000 g&middot;mol/ton mixture containing cellulose, depending on the chemical additives and the specific composition of the mixture containing cellulose. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, wherein sodium borohydride is added as the carbonyl-reducing agent and the sole purpose of the at least one step of the treatment is the chemical reduction of carbonyl groups, the charge is between 0.3 and 100 g&middot;mol/ton mixture containing cellulose (on a dry basis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, where sodium borohydride is added as the carbonyl-reducing agent and an additional purpose of the at least one step of the treatment is the delignification of the mixture containing cellulose, the charge is from 0.1 and 500 g&middot;mol/ton mixture containing cellulose (on a dry basis), preferably from 0.1 to 80 g mol/ton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the reducing agent is added as the at least one agent in at least one stage of a multi-stage bleaching process and/or is added as at least one of at least two agents in at least one stages of a multi-stage bleaching process. In particular, the reducing agents can be added simultaneously during the addition of one or more oxidizing agents, known to the expert in the field as the traditional bleaching agents, at one or more stages during a multi-stage bleaching process. It is also conceivable, that adding reducing and oxidizing agents occur as alternating or subsequent steps, optionally separated by steps of washing or otherwise treating the specialty cellulose pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The reducing agent may be added together with any other agent or substance, so long as the at least one additional agent does not prevent the reducing agent to at least partly reduce at least a part of the carbonyl groups. In a preferred embodiment, the pH achieved in the pulp upon adding the at least one reducing agent is below 12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As far as the at least one oxidizing agent that may be added in a multi-stage bleaching process is concerned, any agent(s) known to the expert in the field may be used. Examples of such oxidizing agents may be selected from but are not limited the following group: chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite, chlorite, oxygen, per-compounds such as peroxide, and ozone, as well as mixtures of two or more of the aforementioned substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Another agent that is commonly used during the bleaching process of a specialty cellulose pulp, namely sodium hydroxide, may be added before and/or during and/or after any of the at least one step of bleaching as mentioned above. The main purpose of adding sodium hydroxide is the extraction of at least a part of the hemicellulose portion of the pulp, as well as, to some extent, regulation of the pH value. The amount and/or conditions under which the sodium hydroxide is to be added are known to the expert in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned treatment of the mixture containing cellulose, can be carried out in any reaction device known to the expert in the field in the context of pulp bleaching processes, for example in a bleaching tower, so long as the device is adapted to comply with health and safety issues related to the use of the specific reducing agent(s) and/or any other agent used. There are no limitations as to the design and/or function of the reaction device. For example, it may be a vessel or a tube, operated in batch mode or continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, said reaction device will be a steel tower of the type known to the expert for commercial-scale cellulose pulp bleaching processes. In a further preferred embodiment, the device will be of dimensions such that cellulose retention time under reaction conditions ranges from up to 6 hours. Preferably, the device is of sufficient dimensions so that the reaction time ranges up to 3.5 hours. The actual size of the reaction device is, inter alia, determined by the pulp production rate in a continuous process and, correspondingly, by the batch volume in a batch process. Preferably, the reaction device is fitted with a fan capable of maintaining a level of hydrogen gas well below the explosion limit since hydrogen gas may be generated during treatment with a borohydride. Any other method capable of keeping the amount of hydrogen in the reaction device below the explosion limit, such as hydrogen scavengers, controlled reactions of hydrogen or purging the reaction device with inert gases or mixtures containing inert gases may be used as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The mixture containing cellulose that is to be subjected to the at least one step of the treatment according to the invention is pumped into the aforementioned reaction device. Preferably, it is pumped in the device in the form of an aqueous slurry, having a content ranging from 0.1 to 40 wt % of pulp based on dry mass of the mixture containing cellulose, preferably a content ranging from 1 to 25 wt %, further preferred ranging from 5 to 15 wt %. The mixing of the slurry with the reducing agents may take place either inside or outside the reaction device, by means of a chemical mixer or any other means that produces homogeneous mixing. Any other chemicals added to the reactor device (e.g. for pH adjustment, bleaching purposes, hemicellulose extraction purposes or as chemical aids to the main chemical functions in the process stage) may also be mixed into the slurry inside or outside the reaction device. Preferably, any mixing takes place outside of the reactor device, as this facilitates the formation of an homogeneous reaction slurry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As far as the temperature at which the at least one reducing agent is added to the mixture containing cellulose, is concerned, any temperature is conceivable at which the at least one reducing agent at least partly reduces carbonyl groups contained in the mixture. In case of an integrated method comprising several process stages, in particular several stages of bleaching, the process temperature may be chosen to be suitable for all stages. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature will be set as to optimize the integrated process, or, if necessary, regulated as to optimize each stage individually. In a further preferred embodiment, the multistage bleaching process is carried out at a temperature ranging from ambient temperature to 140&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment and in particular if the chemical reduction of carbonyl groups in the pulp is the primary object, the temperature for the bleaching process ranges from ambient temperature to 80&deg; C., further preferred from 35&deg; C. to 75&deg; C. and yet further preferred from 50&deg; C. to 60&deg; C. Furthermore, if the function of the inventive treatment also relates to delignification or to any form of bleaching, in addition to chemical reduction of carbonyl groups, the temperature of the reaction device is set to a value that allows the best combination of bleaching action and chemical reduction of carbonyl groups. In a process stage of the process in which common bleaching chemicals known to the expert in the field are used, temperatures should preferably range from ambient temperature to 80&deg; C., further preferred from 30&deg; C. to 70&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The heating of the reactor device is effected using heaters or heat-exchangers of the type known to the expert in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The pH-value of the pulp slurry containing the previously described active chemical agents should be between 7 and 14. As for the case of temperature, the pH of a preferred embodiment of the invention depends on the full process function of the process stage in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Most preferably, especially if sodium borohydride is used as the carbonyl-reducing chemical, the pH should be maintained between 8 and 14, in a preferred embodiment between 10 and 13 as to minimize decomposition of the borohydride moiety and subsequent hydrogen gas release. A pH between 11 and 12 is particularly preferred. For the same reason, it is preferable to adjust the pH of the pulp slurry to a sufficiently high pH prior to the addition of sodium borohydride. This can be achieved by adding sodium hydroxide to the slurry at a point between the previous process stage and the addition of sodium borohydride. The amount of sodium hydroxide added depends on the pH of the mixture containing cellulose that is fed from the previous process stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Should the process stage where the invention is applied have the additional function of delignification or other bleaching action using common bleaching chemicals, the pH of the slurry in the reactor device should preferably be set at a value from pH 8 to 14, wherein the specific value chosen should best suit the optimal combination of bleaching and chemical reduction of carbonyl groups in the pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As a result of the treatment of the mixture containing cellulose described above, in particular after treating said mixture in a bleaching process comprising at least one stage of adding a reducing agent, a treated mixture containing cellulose is obtained. In the context of the present invention, this mixture is referred to as (treated) &ldquo;specialty cellulose pulp&rdquo;, i.e. as a pulp that has been treated and can now be further processed to obtain specialty cellulose products. By way of example, one class of products obtainable from specialty cellulose pulp are cellulose ethers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Said cellulose ethers, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, methylhydroxyethylcellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, ethylcellulose, and mixtures of at least two components thereof, are used as additives in a large range of household and industrial products. The main purpose of adding said cellulose ethers to other materials lies in the possibility of controlling the rheological properties of said materials. The viscosity of the cellulose ether solution (henceforth termed cellulose ether viscosity), which is strongly related to the degree of polymerisation (DP) of the cellulose in the pulp feedstock, is therefore one of the most important properties of cellulose ethers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The upper limit of cellulose ether viscosity that can be obtained is per se limited by the upper limit of the cellulose DP in the specialty cellulose pulp from which the cellulose ether is derived, as well as by the DP of the cellulose ether molecule following etherification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a large proportion of products containing cellulose ethers, the appearance of the product is of high importance. Value is often attached to a cellulose ether solid that is as white as possible, and to a cellulose ether solution that is as transparent as possible. The upper limit of brightness of cellulose ether that may be achieved is principally limited by the upper limit of the ISO brightness of the specialty cellulose pulp from which it is derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The brightness achievable for commercial cellulose ether products is also indirectly limited by the viscosity of the specialty cellulose pulp feed-stock. This is because of a tradeoff in the production of specialty cellulose pulp between high ISO brightness and high cellulose DP in the specialty cellulose pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The specialty cellulose pulp as obtained after the inventive treatment with at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl group and after any other optional treatment, in particular after bleaching in a multi-stage bleaching process, can now be subjected to any step of post-treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Of particular importance in this context is the removal of water from the specialty cellulose pulp. This can be achieved by filtering, pressing, drying at temperatures above room temperature, applying a pressure that is below the partial pressure of water etc. Examples of other post-bleaching steps, that may be applied either prior to, during, or after water removal, are, but are not limited to, removal of fines, enzyme treatments, and the addition of or treatments with chemical agents to improve pulp processability characteristics. In a preferred embodiment, the specialty cellulose is present in the form of a solid sheet or powder, preferably obtained after at least one step of post-treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The specialty cellulose pulp obtained as described above can be subjected to any step of further processing and/or derivatization. Of particular interest in the context of the present invention is any process of forming cellulose derivatives. Cellulose ethers and/or cellulose esters are of particular importance in this context. Following bleaching and post-treatment (including a possible stage of drying), the specialty cellulose sheets are packed in a roll or sheets of a given configuration determined by the cellulose derivative producer and transported to the cellulose derivative producer. There, the sheets are typically cut up or ground to a powder. In the case of cellulose ethers, the pulp pieces or powder is typically pre-treated with sodium hydroxide at below room temperature and reacted with the desired etherifying agents in an oxygen-free environment at temperatures between 60 and 100&deg; C. The cellulose ether product is washed free of salts, dried and often ground to become the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The viscosity of a cellulose ether as obtained from the specialty cellulose pulp as described above can be improved by at least 8-50% using the treatment as disclosed in this invention compared to the same product not subjected to the at least one step of adding of at least one reducing agent during the processing of the specialty cellulose pulp. Characteristic advantages of the method according to the invention over the prior art for etherification products obtained from the specialty cellulose pulp (in a substantially oxygen-free environment) are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the effect of the method according to the invention as applied to a mixture containing cellulose from wood pulp is shown. The viscosity of a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), i.e. a cellulose derivative obtained via etherification from the specialty cellulose pulp according to the invention, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Here the viscosity of the end product, CMC, (vertical axis; units: mPa s) is shown as a function of the limiting viscosity number of the specialty cellulose pulp as defined in the standard &ldquo;SCAN-CM 15:99&rdquo; horizontal axis, units: ml/g). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that across a broad range of specialty cellulose degree of polymerization (as represented by its limiting viscosity number values), the corresponding viscosity of a 1% aqueous solution of CMC varies linearly, irrespective of whether the mixture containing cellulose is treated according to the invention (open squares; solid line indicates least square fit) or if the mixture had not been treated with at least one reducing agent (open triangles). The data clearly show two distinct linear relationships for treated and untreated pulps. However, the viscosity of the CMC resulting form the treated specialty cellulose pulp is constantly about 200 mPa s higher than the viscosity of the untreated, but otherwise same, mixture. These data provide clear evidence that specialty cellulose pulp that had not been treated according to the invention does not reach its fullest degree of polymerization (DP) during etherification, as evidenced by a significantly lower viscosity of the end product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The large effect of the at least partial reduction of carbonyl groups in a specialty cellulose pulp on the brightness of its cellulose ether derivative was particularly unexpected. It has been found that the brightness could be improved from 5% to 80%. This effect is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where the brightness of CMC powder (vertical axis, units: % brightness) is shown as a function of the intrinsic ISO brightness of the specialty cellulose pulp from which the CMC powder has been obtained by means of etherification (horizontal axis; units: % brightness). It can be clearly seen that the brightness of the treated specialty cellulose pulp (open squares) results in a brightness that is from 5 to 20% higher than the corresponding brightness of the powder resulting from the untreated specialty cellulose pulp (open triangles). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to the product of the inventive process, i.e. to a treated specialty cellulose pulp obtainable by a process comprising the treatment of a mixture containing cellulose, wherein the treatment comprises at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups. In particular, an integrated process may be employed. This process comprises at least the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (I) Chemical or chemical and mechanical pulping of a raw material containing cellulose resulting in a mixture (I) containing cellulose; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (II) treating an unpulped mixture containing cellulose or treating a mixture (I) containing cellulose, wherein the treatment comprises at least one step of adding at least one agent capable of reducing carbonyl groups, resulting in a treated specialty cellulose pulp (II); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (III) at least one step of post-processing of the specialty cellulose pulp (I); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> wherein the steps (I) and (III) are optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, step (II) is performed as part of a multi-stage bleaching process. In a further preferred embodiment, the step (III) of post-processing comprises at least one step of removing water and/or of drying at temperatures above room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The specialty cellulose pulp as claimed in this invention can be used for any application for which specialty cellulose pulp is better suited than regular pulp used for the manufacture of paper or cardboard. In particular, all applications in which cellulose molecules alone or in combination with other materials can be used, are included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> By way of example but without the intent to limit the scope of the invention, the following areas of use are mentioned: manufacture of cellulose derivatives, in particular of cellulose ethers or cellulose esters; textile fibers, in particular viscose or high tenacity rayon yarn, non-woven fabrics; micro-crystalline cellulose, formulations for food, in particular as edible diet food, pharmaceutical or cosmetics applications, technical filters, absorbing materials, fluff fibers, photographic papers, as an additive during plastic molding, the use of said fibers in graft copolymerisation, as a component in composite materials, applications in packaging, paints, inks, thickeners, LCD screens, high value specialty papers, laminates, battery separators, electrical circuits and the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Production of Specialty Cellulose Pulp According to the Invention and Subsequent Carboxymethylation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Norway spruce was cooked in batch using the acid sulfite process. Once cooking was complete, the pulp had a mean kappa number (SCAN method C 1:77) of 46. This pulp was transferred to a bleach plant typical of the design found in other bleach plants used in the manufacture of specialty and other cellulose pulps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In this first example the pulp bleaching process consists of four distinct, industrial scale stages, working continuously and in series, followed in series by a one stage, industrial-scale embodiment of the inventive treatment. All these stages, with the exception of the inventive treatments, are variations on bleach treatments common in the specialty cellulose and other cellulose pulp industries, and are well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The main treatment at each of the five stages comprising this example is carried out in stainless steel reactors commonly known as bleach towers, some of which are lined inside with chemically resistant materials, typical of those commonly used in the specialty cellulose and other cellulose pulp industries. Some additional but important procedures, such as washing, dilution, filtration, and chemical dosing, are carried out either prior to the pulp entering, or after the pulp leaving the towers. Details of the conditions inside each of the five towers and the bleaching, extraction chemical, and reducing agent dosages used in this example of the invention can be found in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; as used in the context of the present invention refers to the dry mass of pulp in weight percent with respect to the total mass of pulp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The first stage of this example of the invention, the stage (E<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>), is an alkaline extraction. In this stage, in addition to the main component NaOH, a borohydride is added in the form of Borol Solution&reg; (a 12 wt % solution of sodium borohydride in 40 wt % aqueous sodium hydroxide purchased from Rohm and Haas). The dosage of Borol Solution&reg; was 5 kg/ton pulp (dry basis) which amounts to 15.9 g moles of sodium borohydride per ton dry pulp. This dosage was carried out immediately prior to the pulp entering the tower. Prior to the dosage of sodium borohydride, the pulp was twice washed with deionized water, passed over a filter and press dewatered. Following pressing and prior to the sodium borohydride dosage, 58 kg/ton pulp (dry basis) of sodium hydroxide was dosed. Immediately prior to the pulp entering the E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the consistency of the pulp slurry was 11.5%. In the E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>bleach tower, the temperature was maintained at 95&deg; C. The residence time of the pulp slurry at the base of the E<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower was 132 minutes. The alkaline extraction stage serves the purpose of hemicelluose removal and the borohydride serves as an additive to eliminate some of the loss in strength of paper induced by the alkaline extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The second stage, namely the stage (D<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>), is a chlorine dioxide treatment. Prior to entering the D<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the pulp slurry was pressed and washed with deionized water, then washed a second time over a filter. Prior to the pulp entering the D<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the pH was adjusted to 1.9, and 8.2 kg/ton pulp (dry basis) of chlorine dioxide was dosed. Following this chemical dosage, the consistency of the pulp slurry was 3.5%. In the D<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the temperature was maintained at 15&deg; C. The residence time of the pulp slurry in the D<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower was 43 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The third stage, namely the stage (P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>), is an oxidative bleaching stage using hydrogen peroxide. Prior to entering the P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the pulp-slurry was washed with deionized water over a filter. The pH of the pulp slurry was then adjusted to 10.9 using sodium hydroxide, and 2.0 kg/ton pulp (dry basis) hydrogen peroxide was added. The consistency of the pulp slurry was then 10%. In the P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>tower, the temperature was maintained at 35&deg; C. The residence time of the pulp slurry in the P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>bleach tower was 125 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The fourth stage, namely the stage (D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), is a chlorine dioxide treatment. Prior to entering the D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>tower, the pulp was washed with deionized water over a filter. The pH of the pulp slurry was then adjusted to 2.5 using sulphur dioxide, and 10 kg/ton pulp (dry basis) of chlorine dioxide was dosed. In the D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>tower, the temperature was maintained at 45&deg; C. The residence time of the pulp slurry in the D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>tower was 148 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The fifth stage of this example of the invention, namely the stage (B), has the sole purpose of effecting chemical reduction of the carbonyl groups in the pulp, and is therefore the inventive borohydride treatment. Sodium borohydride was dosed in the form of Borol Solution&reg;. The dosage of Borol Solution&reg; was 5 kg/ton pulp (dry basis), which amounts to 15.9 g moles of sodium borohydride per ton dry pulp. This dosage was carried out immediately prior to the pulp entering the B tower. Prior to the dosage of sodium borohydride, the pulp was washed with deionized water over a filter and the pH of the slurry adjusted to 11.5 using sodium hydroxide. Immediately prior to the slurry entering the B tower, its consistency was 10%. In the B tower, the temperature was maintained at 55&deg; C. The residence time of the pulp slurry in the B tower was 163 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After leaving the B tower, the pulp slurry was washed with deionized water over a filter and the pH adjusted to 4. The pulp was then transported to the drying section of the specialty cellulose manufacturing process, where it was screened, washed in deionized water, and dried to a moisture content of 7%. The dried pulp was packed in a form (approx. 20 ton rolls) typical of finished product specialty cellulose that is ready for sale to other parties wishing to use this as raw material for a cellulose derivatization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The properties of the finished specialty cellulose product can be found in Table 2.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In this example, a 50 g sample of the specialty cellulose pulp manufactured using the treatment described in Example 2 and with properties as found in Table 4 was treated as per an embodiment of the inventive treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The 50 g pulp sample was partitioned into two equal halves of 25 g each. These samples were separately wet and torn into strips in 2.5 L of deionized water. The pulp suspension was then homogenized using a desintegrator (a steel rotor blade of 6 cm diameter rotating at 600 RPM for 30 seconds). Both pulp suspensions were transferred into the same sealable plastic container. Into the pulp suspension was added 0.233 g of Borol Solution&reg;), amounting to 5 kg of Borol Solution&reg;/ton pulp (dry basis), or 15.9 g moles of sodium borohydride per ton pulp (dry basis). The pH was then adjusted to 11.2 using sodium hydroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The container containing the pulp suspension was sealed and shaken, and set in a water bath at a temperature of 55&deg; C. for 180 minutes. The pulp suspension was then washed twice with 51 of deionized water and dried to a moisture content of 7%. The limiting viscosity number and the ISO brightness of the pulp following the inventive treatment were found to be unchanged from those of the pulp prior to applying the inventive treatment. The pulp properties are therefore the ones found in Table 5. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A product and process for imparting stain and water repellancy to fabric, wherein a heat-curable resin which has the property of imparting stain and water repellancy to fabric when applied in proper amount to the fabric and cured, and that can be dispensed as an aerosol, is mixed in suitable proportion with a diluent and placed in an aerosol container along with a suitable propellant. The composition is then sprayed onto the fabric until the fabric is wet. The concentration of the resin in the composition is such that when the fabric is wet with the composition, an appropriate amount of the resin is on the fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to it when the fabric is dried and the resin cured. Curing of the resin can be accomplished by ironing the fabric, or by drying the fabric in a clothes dryer at normal settings. A preferred resin is FS-7520, an aqueous-based concentrated fluoropolymer system, manufactured by Fiber-Shield Industries, Inc. of Yaphank, N.Y., diluted with water to obtain a concentration of 3%-4% solids in the composition used in the invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to products and processes for the treatment of fabrics to render them stain and water repellant. In particular, the invention relates to a product and process for consumer application of a stain and water repellant composition to fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fabrics are often treated to impart stain and water repellancy to them. These treatments are frequently conducted on a commercial scale, wherein a suitable water proofing and stain resistant composition is applied to large sheets or rolls of the fabric to be treated. The composition is typically applied by spraying, padding, roller coating or knife coating. In some processes, the fabric is passed through a bath containing the composition, and then passed through a drying oven to dry the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The commercial products used for making fabrics stain and water repellant include the systems sold by Fiber-Shield Industries of Yaphank, N.Y., under the names FS-7550 and FS-7520. The FS-7550 product is a concentrated fluoropolymer water system, and is slightly cationic. It is sold as a liquid in five, thirty and fifty-five gallon containers, and can be applied via spraying, padding, roller coating or knife coating. In use, 4-6 parts, by weight, of FS-7550 are diluted with 96-94 parts of water and mixed for at least three minutes. Isopropyl alcohol can be added as a preservative. When sprayed onto fabric, the composition normally dries in 10 minutes to 1 hour, depending upon ambient conditions and the amount of composition applied to the fabric. When allowed to air dry, full cure can take about 72 hours. Alternatively, 2-3% of FS-7550 can be added to the rinse cycle of a washing machine to add the composition to the fabric. The fabric is then dried in a dryer at 160&deg; F., and/or ironed. However, the slightly cationic property of the composition may cause it to attach to the surface of machinery, resulting in gumming up of the machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The FS-7520 product is an air-cured, mildly cationic concentrated fluoropolymer water system, and is sold as a liquid in five, thirty and fifty-five gallon containers. This product is intended to be applied via spraying, padding or roller coating. In use, 7-10 parts, by weight, of FS-7520 are diluted with 93-90 parts of water and mixed for at least three minutes. Isopropyl alcohol can be added as a preservative. When applied to fabric or carpeting, the composition will be dry to the touch within 10 minutes to 1 hour, depending upon the amount of product sprayed and the ambient conditions. Full cure takes place in approximately 24-48 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Both the FS-7550 and FS-7520 products are intended for use in the commercial treatment of fabric to impart stain and water repellancy, and are formulated and packaged accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other products have been developed for consumer application to fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to the fabric. These consumer products have limited effectiveness, and some have been withdrawn from the market because of their carcinogenic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is need for a safe and effective consumer product that can be applied via aerosol or pressurized container to impart stain and water repellancy to fabrics. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises a superior, heat-curable, non-toxic, resin-based aqueous composition that is packaged in an aerosol or pressurized container for consumer application to fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The concentration of the effective resin-based component in the composition is such that the consumer simply sprays the composition onto the fabric until the fabric is wet, whereupon the appropriate amount of the effective component will have been applied to the fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to the fabric. The wetted fabric is then ironed or placed in a typical clothes dryer and dried at a normal setting. The heat generated by ironing and/or drying the fabric in a clothes dryer sets or cures the resin-based component, imparting a stain and water repellant property to the fabric that is superior to the results obtained with prior art consumer products and processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Applicant has found that the FS-7520 composition of Fiber-Shield Industries, when suitably modified, makes a superior and preferred composition for consumer application via aerosol or pressurized container. The FS-7520 composition comprises 14-16% solids, and applicant dilutes this with water to 3-4% solids. A suitable commercially available corrosion inhibitor may also be added. The diluted composition is then packaged in an aerosol or pressurized container for consumer use as described above.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a heat-curable resin which has the property of imparting stain and water repellancy to fabric when applied in proper amount to the fabric and cured, and that can be dispensed as an aerosol, is mixed in suitable proportion with a diluent and placed in an aerosol container. The composition is then sprayed onto the fabric until the fabric is wet. The concentration of the resin in the composition is such that when the fabric is wet with the composition, an appropriate amount of the resin is on the fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to it when the fabric is dried and the resin cured. Curing of the resin can be accomplished by ironing the fabric, or by drying the fabric in a clothes dryer at normal settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A particular resin which has been found suitable for use in the composition of the invention is FS-7520, manufactured by Fiber-Shield Industries, Inc. of Yaphank, N.Y. FS-7520 is an aqueous-based concentrated fluoropolymer system that cures at ambient temperatures. For use in the invention, this product is diluted with water to 3%-4% solids, and, if desired, a suitable commercially available corrosion inhibitor added. The composition is then packaged in a conventional aerosol or pressurized container for use by a consumer to impart stain and water repellancy to fabrics. The consumer simply sprays the composition onto the fabric until the fabric is wet, and the concentration of resin in the composition is such that when the fabric is wet an appropriate amount of the resin will be present on the fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to it when the fabric is dried and the resin cured by application of heat. Curing of the resin can be accomplished by ironing the fabric, or by drying it in a clothes dryer at normal settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Treatment of fabric in accordance with the invention produces results superior to those obtained by prior art products and processes, and is easily achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a typical conventional aerosol dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which can be used in practicing the invention. The dispenser includes a container <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a dip tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and actuator-nozzle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A desired quantity of the composition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the invention is placed in the aerosol dispenser by using conventional methods, and a suitable propellant is added to pressurize the contents of the package in order that the resin composition can be sprayed. Further, it is recognized that the product could be sprayed with a finger pump or a trigger sprayer, but this would be tiring for covering large objects. For instance, a raincoat would require eight to ten fluid ounces for coverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically depicts one process for practicing the invention, wherein a heat-curable resin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that can be dispensed as an aerosol is diluted with a suitable diluent <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to obtain a composition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having 3% to 4% solids. In a preferred embodiment, the resin preferably comprises FS-7520 manufactured by Fiber-Shield Industries, Inc. of Yaphank, N.Y., and is diluted with water. The composition is packaged according to conventional methods in a conventional aerosol dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, from which the composition is sprayed onto fabric F until the fabric is wet. The concentration of resin in the composition is such that when the fabric is wet, an appropriate amount of the resin will be present on the fabric to impart stain and water repellancy to it when the fabric is dried and the resin cured. Curing of the resin can be accomplished by ironing the fabric with an iron I. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically depicts another process for practicing the invention, wherein all the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are followed, except that the resin is cured by placing the wetted fabric F in a clothes dryer D to dry the fabric and cure the resin. The fabric may also be ironed and otherwise handled conventionally upon removal from the dryer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Although stain and water repellancy can be imparted to fabric by applying the composition of the invention and permitting it to air-dry under ambient conditions, cross linking or polymerization of the resin is achieved more effectively by subjecting the material to heat, e.g., by ironing the treated fabric or drying it in a clothes dryer after the composition has been applied to the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and intent of the invention as defined by the claims appended hereto.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a cross section of a related art pulsator type washing machine, referring to which a related art pulsator type washing machine will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is an inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a plurality of washing holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed therein rotatably mounted inside of an outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided for storage of washing water, inside of which inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> there is a pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted therein. There is a drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for draining the washing water outside of the washing machine. A rotation power from a motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> mounted on an underside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted to a dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coupled to the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> coupled to the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for rotating the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled/decoupled by a clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, of substantially an annular form, has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed on top both of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extended in an upper and a lower direction from an end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for tight fit to an inside surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>projected from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a substantially vertical direction for being fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tub cover <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided for prevention of noise and overflow of foam as well as prevention of infiltration of foreign matters into a space between the inner tub and the outer tub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned related art pulsator type washing machine will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The washing machine is operative in a washing cycle, a rinsing cycle, and a dewatering cycle, by proceeding through each of which mode in a sequence the washing can be done. In the washing cycle, upon putting the washing machine into operation after placing the laundry in the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the washing water is supplied until it fills to certain levels of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Upon finishing the water supply, the motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> makes intermittent rotations in regular and reverse directions in a state the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is standstill, that leads the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to rotate in the regular and reverse directions for washing the laundry. That is, the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> repeats the regular/reverse direction rotation, to rotate the laundry in of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to form water circulation, as well. Then, the laundry is washed by the impact from the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the water circulation, friction with the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and softening effect of the detergent, and the like. After proceeding the washing cycle for a preset time period, the drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is opened, to drain contaminated washing water to outside of the washing machine. Then, clean washing water is supplied to inside of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is rotated, to make rinsing cycles for a preset number of times. In the dewatering cycle, the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated in a high speed together with the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in one direction in a state the washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled. Consequently, the washing water is discharged to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the washing holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and drained to outside of the washing machine through the drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the related art washing machines, making the washing mostly using mechanical energies, of such as pulsator or agitator, is required to have a rotating power of a certain speed for making an adequate washing, that causes entangle of or damage to the laundry. And, the related art washing machine is involved in an increased washing water and detergent consumed during the washing because the washing machine is operative under a state the washing water is filled in the inner tub and the outer tub, as well as an increased overall washing time period due to increased water supply and drain time periods, that are not directly related to the washing time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has been researches for making washing without rubbing the laundry or applying impact to laundry, one of which is the penetration type washing machine. That is, according to what is known, if a relative flow speed of water passing through between textile fibers of the laundry is greater than a certain level, the water can make a washing, without rubbing or twisting the laundry. A washing machine employing such a principle is a penetration type washing machine. In general, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,191,667, a related art penetration type washing machine is provided with a washing water sprayer for spraying the washing water to the laundry in an inner tub over a required speed, and a separate pump for pumping the washing water to the washing water sprayer. Therefore, the related art penetration type washing machine has problems in that a complicated system and a large sized pump for obtaining a spraying power for the washing are required. Therefore, the related art penetration type washing machine has been mostly used as a supplementary means for the pulsator type washing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> And, though JP S51-13416 discloses a washing machine which makes a penetration washing by rotating an inner tub, the washing machine has the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> First, as the inner tub rotates only in one direction, the washing water penetrates a fixed position of the laundry, to cause a wash difference in which a washed portion and a non-washed portion are happened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Second, the only use of penetration washing makes a washing efficiency poor. Because, though the penetration type washing machine can prevent damage to, and entangling of the laundry, in general, the washing efficiency is poor compared to the pulsator type washing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Third, since the washing machine fails to provide a guide means for guiding the washing water to an inside surface of the inner tub when the washing water is pumped to an upper portion between the inner tub and the outer tub, and then, circulated into the inner tub, the washing machine has a poor pumping efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Use of a related art tub cover for the penetration type washing machine causes leakage of spray of the washing water. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, since the related art tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is merely fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the washing water leaks through gaps between the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer tub, and the fastening portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a top of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. And, a pumped washing water splashes from an inside of the tub cover to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to generate noise as the splash hits a washing water case, and to deteriorate washing and rinsing performances of the washing machine as the splash causes a loss of the washing water. Moreover, the leaked or splashed washing water to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> wets various electric components of the washing machine, that is liable to cause malfunction or disorder of the washing machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. A penetration type washing machine, and a method for controlling the same will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, there is an inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having a plurality of washing holes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted in an outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with a pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> formed as a unit with the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. There is a fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> provided on a top of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for balancing the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during rotation. And, there is a tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> on a top of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for preventing noise, suppressing foam formation, and guiding the washing. There is a motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for generating a rotation power under the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a drain valve <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is preferably a variable speed motor, with a rotating shaft thereof being directly coupled to a single driving shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which rotates the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> without introduction of additional power transmission device. The aforementioned penetration type washing machine of the present invention facilitates a penetration washing, an agitation washing, and a restoration circulation washing by varying a rotation speed of the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned penetration type washing machine of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The penetration type washing will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. When the washing machine is put into operation, the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is rotated in a high speed. Then, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> connected to the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is rotated, and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> connected to the driving shaft is also rotated in a high speed. As has been explained in the related art, the penetration washing requires a relative flow speed of the washing water passing through the laundry to be higher than a certain level, and the flow speed should be enough to generate a centrifugal force that can force the washing water to flow from the inner tub to the outer tub and, therefrom to circulate to the inner tub again. When the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is rotated at a high speed, a centrifugal force is generated, to push the laundry in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to a wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and to push the washing water in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the washing holes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, when the washing water penetrates through between textile fabrics of the laundry, thereby making the penetration washing. And, the washing water pushed out to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the washing water present on a bottom surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is pumped upward along a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the centrifugal force, until the washing water hits the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> where the washing water turns a flow direction to flow into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> again. The washing water flowed into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has a substantially high pressure caused by the centrifugal force coming from the high speed rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the washing water can apply an impact to the laundry by the pressure from the centrifugal force and a gravity of the washing water, to provide a beating effect to the laundry, that improves a washing efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as has been explained in the related art, in the case when the inner tub rotates only in one direction, the wash difference is happened in which extents of wash differ depending on portions of the laundry because positions of the laundry are always fixed. Therefore, the inner tub is rotated in a reverse direction after the inner tub is rotated in a regular direction for a preset time period. Then, the laundry pushed to wall of the inner tub is gathered to a center of the inner tub when the inner tub changes its direction of rotation from regular direction to reverse direction, and the laundry is pushed onto the wall again as the inner tub is accelerated. Accordingly, as a position of the laundry through which the washing water penetrates is changed, the wash difference can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as has been explained, the penetration type washing machine of the present invention permits, not only the penetration type washing, but also agitation type and restoration circulation washings by changing a speed and a direction of rotation of the motor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates an agitation washing process, referring to which the agitation washing process will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The agitation washing is available by setting the rotation speed to be below a certain level. That is, if the rotation speed of the motor is set to be comparatively low, the pulsator and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> also rotate at a low speed, at which the centrifugal force is dropped unable to push up the washing water between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but to keep a certain level. And, the laundry pushed to the wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> drops down to the bottom of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be submerged in the washing water. Under this state, a water circulation caused by rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> facilitates an agitation washing in a principle identical to a related art pulsator type washing machine. The availability of the penetration washing as well as the agitation washing can provide an excellent washing efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> illustrates a section showing a restoration circulation washing process, referring to which the restoration circulation process will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which is rotating at a high speed in a penetration washing is stopped or has a speed dropped, the laundry pushed to the inside wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by an inertia is gathered to a central portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to hit one another. That is, the hitting among the laundry or with the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can make washing. In this instance, for conduction of the restoration circulation washing, though the rotating inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be stopped, the restoration circulation washing is available without a separate restriction. Because the inner tub repeats regular and reverse rotations in the penetration washing, the restoration circulation washing is automatically and continuously made whenever the direction of rotation is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the penetration washing, the agitation washing, and the restoration circulation washing, a dewatering cycle is conducted. And, upon completion of the dewatering cycle, a water re-supply process is conducted to conduct a following rinsing process. Though the penetration type washing machine of the present invention may only carry out the penetration type washing, it is preferable that the penetration type washing machine carry out an appropriate combination of the penetration type washing, an agitation type washing and a restoration circulation washing depending on an extent of contamination and an amount of the laundry. And, as has been explained, one washing cycle or a rinsing cycle may be divided into small intervals for repeating the penetration washing and the agitation washing in the intervals, or different from this, it is also possible that re-water supply is made to conduct the agitation washing after completion of the penetration washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the penetration type washing machine and a method for controlling the same of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As the penetration type washing machine of the present invention makes the penetration type washing mostly, entangling of, and damage to the laundry is reduced compared to the pulsator type washing machine. The re-supply of the washing water into the inner tub in the penetration type washing facilitates consumption of less washing water, with use of less detergent, and faster washing water supply and drain, that minimizes waste of time in the supply and drain of the washing water. Moreover, the washing water in the outer tub do nothing but interferes the rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in the pulsator type washing machine because the washing water in the outer tub generates a friction when the inner tub is rotated even though the washing water in the inner tub act an important role as the washing water in the inner tub is brought into contact with the laundry to make washing. Therefore, in order to make a smooth rotation, it is important for the inner tub to make a less contact with the washing water in the outer tub as far as possible. By the way, the penetration type washing machine of the present invention has a small amount(approx. 50%) of washing water supplied to the inner tub and the outer tub, and the washing water is pumped into the inner tub again in conducting the washing. That is, as the outer tub has less amount of washing water, rotation of the inner tub is smoother. Different from the related art penetration type washing machine, the penetration type washing machine has a simple system as no separate pumping device are required, and facilitates a satisfactory washing efficiency while preventing entangling of, or damage to the laundry by an appropriate combination of the penetration washing, the agitation washing and the restoration circulation washing. The penetration type washing machine of the present invention has the washing water in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> pumped up to the top portion thereof through a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at a substantially high pressure, to be recirculated into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the high pressure of the washing water pumped upward may cause leakage if the related art tub cover is used as it was. Though this leakage may be prevented by providing gasket on a top surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, accurate fitting of the gasket to a large diametered outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not practicable. Therefore, it is preferable that the tub cover structure of the penetration type washing machine is changed, appropriately. The tub cover of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment tub cover of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The first embodiment tub cover is substantially identical to the one of the related art except that a leakage prevention means is additionally provided in the first embodiment tub cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> That is, similar to the related art tub cover, the first embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. However, different from the related art, the fastening portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> has a downward projection at an approx. center thereof in parallel to the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and there is a slot on a top portion of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for insertion of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> thereto. And, there is a sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> in a space formed between the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> for prevention of leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> And, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> length of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> may be formed shorter, for providing the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> in a space formed below the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sealing member may be disposed on a top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In detail, as the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> is fitted to the top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is projected in an outward radial direction of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a portion below the top end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. And, a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> is formed at an outer circumference of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, with an end of the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> bent downward, to form a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> which fit to an inside surface of the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, without providing the fastening portion. And, in order to make the assembly easy, the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> of the tub cover with adhesive <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. And, it is preferable that a position the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is projected is to be below the top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to provide a space between the top end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Because if leakage of the washing water is happened despite of the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, the leakage of washing water may be collected in the space. The washing water collected in the space is drained using overflow hose(not shown) connected to an air vent hose. The first embodiment tub cover can prevent leakage of the washing water even if the washing water is pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> at a high pressure by means of the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>. And, as the fitting of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> only requires insertion of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> at the tub cover to the slot in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the assembly is simple. And, as the slot serves as a guide, for accurate fitting of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, preventing vibration during operation of the washing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, even if the first tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can prevent leakage of the washing water, neither spray of the washing water caused by hitting the tub cover can be prevented, nor an exact guide of the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is possible. Therefore, the following second to seventh embodiments tub covers of the present invention will provide improved tub covers. The second embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> mounted under the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with a space therefrom, wherein there are washing water guide passages P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed between the upper and lower tub covers. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a substantially annular form of an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> projected from an outer end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> vertically for tight fit to an inside wall of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> extended from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in a horizontal direction for fastening to a top end of the outer tub, forming an &ldquo;L&rdquo; section, substantially. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> projected downward from an outer end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, with a plurality of reinforcing brackets <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> connected between the upper surface portion and the vertical portion. There are a plurality of height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> formed at fixed intervals. In order to couple the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> have a female thread <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, and the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a plurality of fastening holes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> formed at positions corresponding to the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> fastened state will be explained. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are fastened with screws <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is fastened to a top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with screws. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the washing water pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is guided by the guide passage P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover, to guide the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> smoothly, which improves a pumping efficiency. And, the spray of the washing water can be prevented. And, a pressure of the washing water sprayed to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is adjustable by adjusting a space S between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover, i.e., a height of the height adjustment member <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. By the way, there is a possible leakage through a gap between the fastening holes in the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the screws in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is preferable that height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed on the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and pass-through holes are formed in the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Because the washing water flowing from the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> advances in a tangential direction of an inside diameter of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by the centrifugal force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A tub cover having modified such drawback is the third embodiment tub cover, which will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and there are a plurality of deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> on an underside of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for deflecting a flow direction of the washing water. The deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is fitted in a radial direction for deflecting the washing water advancing in a tangential direction to a center direction. There are a plurality of deflectors fitted as fixed intervals to divide the flow paths. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, this structure permits the washing water pumped and flowed into the tub cover <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> hits the deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, to change a direction of flow toward, not the tangential direction, but the center direction, substantially. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there may be a guide rib <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> on the deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for reducing a friction of the washing water. And, a plate drop preventor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may preferably be fitted at a bottom of the deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for preventing drop of the washing water, flowing into the tub cover, into a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by gravity, but to be supplied to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Of course, the drop preventor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may be provided with a larger area or the lower tub cover of the second embodiment may be provided. And, the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the second embodiment may be formed to have forms of the deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, for combined use of the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as the deflectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Because outlets of the washing water passages P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are substantially horizontal in the first to third embodiments tub covers, the washing water flows out substantially in the horizontal direction. Opposite to this, the following fourth to seventh embodiment tub covers are provided with an adjustable spray angle, with a convenience of assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Alike the second embodiment tub cover, the fourth embodiment tub cover also include an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for forming a washing water passage. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> also has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, except that there are a plurality of guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> fitted at fixed intervals provided between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover for combined use as the height adjustment members and the deflectors in the aforementioned embodiments. The guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is preferably formed extended from inlet to outlet of the flow passage to cover the entire washing water passage. In this embodiment, the horizontal passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed to direct a lower portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are provided with downward curvatures to provide a stream lined horizontal passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for minimize a friction. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is mounted spaced from the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by a preset distance T1, with a chamfer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> in the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to suit to a contour of the passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Because this configuration can prevent bumping between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the tub cover <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. And, in order to prevent bumping between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a second gap T2 formed between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be further provided. The distance T1 is preferably identical to the gap T2 between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, substantially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A fastening structure of the fourth embodiment tub cover of the present invention will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Alike the previous embodiment, if the upper tub cover, the guide member and the lower tub cover are fastened with screws, the washing water may leak. Therefore, it is preferable that the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are fabricated separately and jointed them together by means of welding and the like. Of course, it is possible that either the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be fabricated as a unit, to which the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is welded, or the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be fabricated as a unit, to which the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is welded. In this instance, for the sake of convenience of assembly and preventing projection of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to an outward radial direction, there is a stepped portion <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> at one side of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for catching a bottom end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, fastening with screws is also possible, particularly, fastening the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is effective in view of leakage prevention. Similar to the previous embodiments, this embodiment tub cover serves for a smooth guidance of the washing water, prevention of spray, and prevention of leakage. In addition to this, this embodiment tub cover can further improve a pumping performance and washing performance because the washing water passage is streamlined with a preset curvature, which minimizes a loss caused by friction to guide the washing water into a lower portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> effectively. By the way, in this embodiment, fore ends of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, i.e., a width W of an outlet of the washing water may be adjusted for adjusting the pressure of the washing water. That is, the more the width W of the outlet of the washing water is reduced, the higher the pressure of the washing water. The width W may preferably be adjusted by decreasing or increasing a fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> by an angle &thgr; toward a fore end direction of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, the fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be extended or shortened with respect to the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, for adjusting an angle of spray of the washing water. That is, if the fore end of the upper tub cover is shortened by a distance H1 with respect to the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, the washing water is sprayed upward, and extended by a distance H2, sprayed downward. In conclusion, this embodiment allows an appropriate adjustment of the spray pressure and the spray angle. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> radius R1 formed by the fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a radius R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may preferably be made different, to improve a washing water supply efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> are not curved, the washing water is adapted to hit the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> as a right angle, to cause a friction and a consequential reduction of a pumping efficiency. And, the abrupt change of the flow direction of the washing water causes noise coning from impact. And, because the third embodiment tub cover has the deflectors fitted perpendicular to the washing water flow, a portion of the washing water hit onto the deflector turns a flow direction, not to the inner tub, but backwardly opposite to the flow direction of the washing water due to a reaction force. And, a vortex may be occurred in a space formed by an outer circumference of the deflector and the tight fit portion. Those are causes of dropping the pumping efficiency. Accordingly, the following embodiment is a modification for improving such problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fifth embodiment tub cover is the one in which those disadvantages are improved, which will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is formed to have a curvature, for guiding the washing water smoothly with a minimum friction at the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. As the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> rotates in regular and reverse directions, it is preferable that regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided, respectively. Because others are the same with the fourth embodiment, the explanation will be omitted. According to this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, since the washing water pumped by high speed rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is supplied to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> smoothly with a minimum friction, the pumping efficiency can be improved. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, if the regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are integrated, a fore end <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has no curvature, which has a great friction. Therefore, the fore end <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> also need to have a curvature, preferably. To do this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably provided with curvatures throughout entire lengths, with the fore ends thereof connected with a curved portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Thus, since the washing water pumped during a regular direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is guided by the regular direction guide member <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, with a reduced friction, and the washing water pumped during a reverse direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is guided by the reverse direction guide member <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with a reduced friction, the curved members <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can improve the pumping efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, even though the aforementioned tub covers of the present invention can prevent spray of the washing water effectively, once sprayed, the sprayed washing water flows to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the following sixth embodiment tub cover is provided for an effective prevention of spray to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The sixth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Similar to the fourth and fifth embodiment tub covers, the sixth embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> each having a curvature, and a guide members <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. And, the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>. However, in this embodiment, the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is projected upward to form a projection <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to form a recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> between an outer circumference and the projection <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to collect the sprayed washing water. Then, the washing water collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> is drained into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by washing water drain means <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The washing water drain means <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is sloped flow passages <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> recessed in the upper surface of the upper tub cover at fixed intervals, with walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on both sides of the passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. The sloped flow passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is sloped inward downwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the guide member <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> may only be provided on the vertical flow passage <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, because the walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sloped flow passages <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> act as the guide members in the horizontal flow passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the washing water sprayed and collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> flows into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the sloped flow passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, the pumped washing water flows to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through the flow passages formed between the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, when the walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>divide the passage. The walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed with curvatures for guiding the washing water with a reduced friction in correspondence to the regular and reverse rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The washing water drain means may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. That is, a plurality of drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> are formed in the recess of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals. And, guide members for guiding the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from the drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> are preferably provided in the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. Because if there are no guide members, the washing water drained through the drain holes will flow the space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> again, to resist against the circulation of the washing water as the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also has a curvature. The guide member has one pair of walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> formed vertical to the upper surface of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> at a width slightly greater than the width of the discharge hole <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> and a sloped passage <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> connecting the walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> and sloped downwardly in an inner radial direction. The walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> also serve as the height adjustment member. And, a front portion <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> with a supply hole <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> may be provided in front of the walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment tub cover will be explained. The pumped washing water is collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The washing water collected in the recess <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> flows into the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> through the drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>, and into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the sloped passage <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>. Thus, spray of the washing water out of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be prevented. In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, it is, of course, possible that the upper surface of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is provided with a slope &agr; without the washing water drain means, for natural flow of the washing water sprayed to the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the upper surface of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. In this instance, it is preferable that the guide member <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is extended to the horizontal passage, i.e., to form a vertical portion <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The second to sixth embodiment tub covers have complicated structures and high cost because the tub covers include the upper tub covers, the lower tub covers and guide members, which are comparatively many components that is difficulty in assembly. Therefore, the following seventh and eighth embodiment tub covers provide tub covers which have simple structures but have effects the same with the aforementioned embodiments. Different from the foregoing second to sixth tub covers, the following embodiment tub covers have one single tub cover(corresponding to an upper tub cover in the related art). And, different from the first embodiment tub cover, these embodiment tub covers are provided with means on a bottom surface of the tub cover for guiding the washing water into the inner tub. The pumped washing water can be guided into the inner tub only using a tub cover corresponding to an upper tub cover without using a lower tub cover owing to the following reason. The penetration washing requires fast running of the motor for pumping the washing water. That is, in the penetration washing, the washing water should be pumped upwardly to move upward to overcome a gravity of the washing water itself Therefore, as the washing water pumped toward the tub cover does not fall down even if the lower tub cover is used substantially, formation of the washing water passage is possible even if no lower tub cover is used. And, in the case of agitating washing, since the washing water is not circulated and the tub cover only serves for prevention of noise, and foam reduction, the lower tub cover may be dispensed with, too. The seventh embodiment tub cover will be explained in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The seventh embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> includes a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for tight fit on an inside surface of a top end of the outer tub, an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> extended upwardly from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> at an angle for serving as a guide for the washing water, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projected from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> in a horizontal direction for being fastened to the outer tub with screws. The upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> may preferably have a curvature, rather than at a right angle to the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for reducing friction with the washing water. And, there is a vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> formed downwardly at a fore end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> for downward guide of the washing water to a lower portion of the inner tub, and preferably there is a vertical protector <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on an outer circumference of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> for protecting the spray of the washing water to outside of the outer tub. There are a plurality of main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> formed on an underside of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals, for deflecting a direction of the washing water pumped to the tub cover to a center direction of the inner tub. The main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is formed to connect an inner and an outer diameters of the upper surface portion of the tub cover, with an angle &thgr;1 to a radial direction of the tub cover. And, supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> may be further provided for smoother guide of the washing water. The supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> has a fore end started from the inner diameter, extended along a concentric circle with the tub cover substantially, and an aft end ended at a position of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the fore end of the supplementary deflector is preferably spaced from the fore end of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> by a preset distance L2. Therefore, the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is divided by the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> by fixed intervals S, wherein a space between the intervals S has a main flow passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and a supplementary passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The washing water pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is guided by the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> into the inner tub with a minimum friction. In detail, the washing water risen upwardly is brought in contact with a bottom surface of the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Then, the washing water is guided by the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> to deflect a flow direction from a tangential direction to a center direction of the inner tub. And, the washing water having a direction changed by the main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> hits onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> again, to deflect a flow direction from horizontal to vertical downwardly, to supply the washing water to the inner tub lower portion. Most of the pumped washing water is guided by the main flow passages to be sprayed into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, while a portion of the pumped washing water flows into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> directly from the supplementary flow passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Because most of the pumped washing water is guided by the main flow passages and the outlet P of each main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a small width L2 and a limited number, that built up a pressure of the washing water, the washing water is intensely sprayed from the outlets, to improve the washing efficiency. In comparison to this, in the related art, since the washing water is sprayed from an entire inner diameter of the tub cover, the washing efficiency is poor because the spraying pressure is dispersed. Though the washing water flowed in a horizontal direction and hit onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> turns its flow direction downwardly into the inner tub, a portion of the washing water is scattered by the impact of the hit. However, this embodiment tub cover can minimize scattering of the washing water, generation of noise, and foam formation because the washing water hits the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> before the washing water hits the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. And, the washing water still scattered is prevented from leaking beyond an outer wall of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the projection <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A, a</cross-reference> damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> may preferably be provided at the outlet P side of the main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the washing water hits the damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> beforehand, for effective prevention of the scattering of the washing water occurred when the washing water hits the vertical deflectors <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. The damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> is disposed substantially perpendicular to a flow direction of the washing water, i.e., connected from a fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> to a fore end of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, with a height lower than heights of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>B, instead of the damping member, a sloped portion <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> may be provided at an outlet P of the main flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The following eighth embodiment tub cover is a modification from the seventh embodiment tub cover to suit to a case of both direction, i.e., regular and reverse direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. An overall structure of the eighth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Alike the seventh embodiment tub cover, the eighth embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> of the present invention also includes the main deflectors, the supplementary deflectors, and the vertical deflectors, except that first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided in correspondence to the both direction rotation, and a structure of the supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is modified. In detail, the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> are formed on an underside of the upper surface portion of the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals, and the second deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in symmetry to the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. And, a fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a fore end started from the inner circumference and extended along a concentric circle of the tub cover, and an aft end connected to the inner circumference of the tub cover. That is, the fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned spaced from the fore end of the first main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, and the aft end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned spaced from the fore end of the second main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. And, preferably there are a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> between the first main deflectors and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for preventing distortion, and more preferably concentric to the tub cover circumference. And, a portion of an outer rib may be cut away. The ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are fitted under the following reasons. The washing water passed over the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may cause a vortex between the first and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or may flow to the outlet of the main flow passage, to interfere the washing water flow in the main flow passage. Therefore, the ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are provided to confine the washing water between the first and second deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to some extent, for preventing interference to the washing water in the main flow passage. Thus, the tub cover is divided by the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into fixed intervals S. And, a space between the intervals S has a main flow passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and a just prior supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a supplementary passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. And, there is a space formed by the first main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and an adjacent second main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, when the inner tub rotates in a regular direction(a counter clockwise direction on the drawing), most of the washing water pumped to the tub cover is guided by the tub cover as shown in arrows of solid lines to be sprayed into the inner tub through the regular direction outlets P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a minimum friction. Opposite to this, when the inner tub rotates in a reverse direction(a clockwise direction on the drawing), most of the washing water pumped to the tub cover is guided by the tub cover as shown in arrows of dotted lines to be sprayed into the inner tub through the reverse direction outlets P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a minimum friction. Therefore, the eighth embodiment tub cover can cope with all the regular and reverse direction rotation, effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39, a</cross-reference> portion of the regular direction outlet P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reverse direction outlet P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be cut away to form an opening <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, for minimizing the scattering of the washing water caused by the washing water hitting onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 and 41</cross-reference>, identical to the seventh embodiment, either the damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> or the sloped portion <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> is provided for effective prevention of the washing water scattering. And, it is preferable that a sealing member is provided between the tub cover and the outer tub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As has been explained, the penetration type washing machine, the method for controlling the same, and the tub cover for the same have the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> First, the penetration type washing machine can make washing using an appropriate combination of the penetration washing, the agitating washing, and the restoration circulation washing. Therefore, a washing efficiency can be improved while damage to, and entangling of the laundry is minimized. And, the washing can be carried out only with a small amount of washing water, consumption of water and detergent may be reduced, with consequential reduction of drain time period, to reduce an overall washing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Second, the tub cover of the present invention can improve a pumping efficiency of the washing water because leakage or scattering of the pumped washing water can be prevented and the washing water can be guided into the inner tub without friction loss. And, the noise and foam caused by the circulated washing water at the high speed rotation of the inner tub can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Third, as the tub cover of the present invention facilitates spray of the pumped washing water toward a center of the inner tub, a washing efficiency can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the penetration type washing machine, the method for controlling the same, and the tub cover for the same of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method to change the color of hair. The method includes measuring an initial reflectance spectrum of a sample of the hair and analyzing a contribution of a plurality of natural hair factors to the initial reflectance spectrum. The method also includes calculating a hair treatment based on another reflectance spectrum. A system to measure a reflectance spectrum of a sample includes an integrating sphere having a sampling port and an inner surface and a window disposed near to the sampling port. The window is configured for being placed in close contact with the sample. The system also includes a light source configured to project light onto the sample via the window and a light detector configured to analyze light reflected from the inner surface to produce the reflectance spectrum of the sample. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hair treatment and, in particular, it concerns an apparatus to measure a hair reflectance spectrum and a method to determine an appropriate hair treatment based directly upon a hair reflectance spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, each strand of hair consists of three layers, namely, the medulla, cortex and cuticle. The medulla is the innermost layer of the hair and is composed of a softer keratin-rich material and its occurrence in human hair appears to be variable, usually being present in large thick hairs. The cuticle is the outermost surface of the hair shaft and is composed of a very hard keratinous substance. It consists of flattened platelets of amorphous keratin, wrapped around the hair shaft in several layers, each layer overlapping the adjacent one, progressing from the root to the tip of the hair. Lastly, the cortex is the inner bulk of the hair, which forms the main body of the hair. The cortex is disposed between the medulla and the cuticle. It is composed of a much softer, fibrous, crystalline keratin. It provides strength, color and texture to the hair. Human hair gets its colors from specialized cells in the hair follicle called melanocytes that produce the pigment for hair. Humans normally produce two type of melanin, namely, Eumelanin and Pheomelanin. Eumelanin is associated with a dark brown color and Pheomelanin is associated with an orange color. Brown and black hair is given its color primarily by Eumelanin. Red hair is given its color primarily by Pheomelanin. Blond hair and hair that has gone white with age have very few of either pigment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A hair treatment to change an initial hair color to a final hair color normally involves bleaching and/or dyeing. The hair may need to be bleached to reduce the natural Eumelanin and Pheomelanin pigments. The extent of the bleaching depends upon the initial and final hair color. A diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide is generally used as the bleaching agent. The oxygen in the diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide opens up the cuticle of the hair so that the bleaching agent can enter into the cortex to remove the Eumelanin and Pheomelanin pigments. Once bleaching is complete, the hair dye is applied to the hair, if necessary. The hair dye also includes oxygen, which opens up the cuticle of the hair so that the coloring agent can enter into the cortex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the accuracy of the hair coloring process relies upon the skill of the hairdresser to determine how much bleaching is required and which hair dye or combination of hair dyes should be applied to provide the customer with the desired final color. Part of the hairdresser&apos;s skill is based upon accumulated experience as well as guidelines issued by the dye manufacturer. However, the final color is often a matter of surprise to both the hairdresser and the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. No. 4,434,467 to Scott. The patent to Scott describes a method whereby the customer chooses a color from a database that is the closest match to his or her own hair color. The customer then chooses a desired final color from the database. The computer then suggests a treatment based on the manufacturer instructions. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the customer has to determine by visual comparison, the closest match to his or her own hair color. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the system is limited to hair treatments, which are based upon a fixed selection of initial hair colors, thereby not taking into account the individual&apos;s hair color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,484 to Hawiuk. Hawuik teaches the use of color filament swatches to recreate the initial hair color and then to add color filament swatches, which are related to a known hair dye, to see how the initial hair color is affected by the hair dye. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the system is not accurate. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that determining the initial color involves a high degree of estimation. An additional shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that this system does not address bleaching of the initial hair color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Of most relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,067,504, 6,157,445, 6,308,088, 6,314,372 and 6,330,341 to MacFarlane, et el. These patents discuss a method, which first includes obtaining a reflectance spectrum from a sample of hair. The coefficients of the Hunter L, a and b color coordinates of the reflectance spectrum of the hair sample are then analyzed by a computer. The initial hair color is then classified by the computer according to a range of coefficients of the color coordinates stored in a lookup table. A user then chooses a desired hair color from a choice of possible final colors. The computer then determines the appropriate hair treatment based upon a hair treatment stored in a lookup table for the initial hair color and the desired final hair color. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is due to the initial hair color being classified according to an artificial color, which fits into a range of possible colors. Therefore, the suggested hair treatment does not accurately reflect the users initial hair color. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the creation and maintenance of the hair treatment lookup table requires a vast number of experiments. For example, for each hair dye, experiments are needed for all the possible initial and final hair colors that can be achieved for that dye. Additionally, the use of the L, a, b color coordinate system can be misleading in certain cases. For example, two samples of hair, which look substantially the same to the human eye may have the same L, a, b color coordinate values even though they have different spectrums of reflectance. For example, one natural blond hair sample which is colored with dye A, may have the same color coordinates as another hair sample, say, a brown hair colored with a dye B. Therefore, simply looking at the L, a, b color coordinates may lead to spurious results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is therefore a need for a method to determine a hair treatment based directly upon a person&apos;s initial hair color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a large sample of hair is typically required to produce a usable reflectance spectrum of hair. Therefore, there is a need for a system and method to produce a usable reflectance spectrum of hair without having to remove the hair from the customer&apos;s head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present invention is an apparatus to measure a hair reflectance spectrum and method of operation thereof as well as a method to determine an appropriate hair treatment based directly upon a hair reflectance spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The principles and operation of a hair reflectance measuring apparatus and a method to determine an appropriate hair treatment based directly upon a hair reflectance spectrum according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention can also be applied to other applications including dyeing of fabrics and other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a schematic view of a reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is constructed and operable in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. Reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a light-probing device, such as an integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a sampling port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are commonly used in many optical applications. Inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coated with a substance, which enables inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to exhibit very high diffusive reflectance properties, such as Beryllium Sulfate. A transparent window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed across sampling port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to prevent dirt, contaminants and other foreign substances from entering into integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally and more importantly, window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also enables close contact between integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by flattening hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It is preferable for hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be flat during the measurement of the reflectance spectrum. Reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an optical fiber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects light onto hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an optical fiber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is typically a spectrophotometer. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to analyze light reflected from inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to produce a reflectance spectrum of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In use, window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in close contact with attached hair, attached hair being hair which is still attached to the head. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects light onto hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Light then reflects off of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> onto inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The light then exits integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via optical fiber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then produces the reflectance spectrum of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be arranged in various orientations with respect to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be substituted by other light probing devices. Before reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to measure a reflectance spectrum, reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is calibrated by measuring the reflectance spectrum of a white reference material. The white reference material has very high reflectance properties and is typically packaged with integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Once this calibration measurement has been made, all future reflectance spectra are compared to the reflectance spectrum of the white reference material. Therefore, the typical reflectance spectrum of a sample is displayed as a graph of percentage reflectance (as compared to the white reflectance material) versus wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, the present invention utilizes natural hair factors, such as Eumelanin, Pheomelanin and other factors which contribute to the reflectance spectra of hair to predict a final hair color based upon a hair treatment or to determine an appropriate hair treatment based upon a desired final hair color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a chart of percentage reflectance against wavelength in nm showing the reflectance spectra of three factors contributing to the reflectance spectra of natural hair that is operable in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The inventors of the present invention measured the reflectance spectra of a large sample of natural hairs and bleached hairs and then performed factor analysis to determine the reflectance spectra of the natural hair factors that contribute to the reflectance spectra of hair. It was also found that bleaching does not add another factor to the reflectance spectrum of hair. Factor analysis is known to one skilled in the art of factor analysis. Additionally, factor analysis is described in the following publications. First, D. Noy, L. Fiedor, G. Hartwich, H. Scheer and A. Scherz (1998) Metal substituted bacteriochlorophylls; 2. Changes in redox potentials and electronic transition energies are dominated by intramolecular electrostatic interactions. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 3684-3693. Second, Noy, R. Yerushalmi, V. Brumfeld, I Ashur, H. Scheer, Kim Baldridg and A. Scherz, (2000) Optical Absorption and Computational Studies of &lsqb;Ni&rsqb;-Bacteriochlorophyll-a. New Insight into charge Distribution between Metal and Ligands. J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 122 (16), 3937-3944 Malinowski, E. R. Factor Analysis in Chemistry; 2nd ed.; Wiley: 1991. The inventors initially performed their analysis assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to three factors. The first natural hair factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is due to the Eumelanin pigment in hair. The second natural hair factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is due to the Pheomelanin pigment in hair. The third factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is known as the white factor. The white factor is probably related to the characteristics of the keratin. The above three factors are the three main factors present in natural hair. The coefficients of the factors determine the reflectance spectrum for a particular hair. For example, a person with dark hair has a high coefficient of the Eumelanin factor and a person with red hair has a high coefficient of the Pheomelanin factor. The inventors extended their research assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to four factors as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a chart of percentage reflectance against wavelength in nm for four factors. In addition to the Eumelanin factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the Pheomelanin factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the white factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, there is a fourth factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which seems to relate to a consistent error of the apparatus used to measure the reflectance spectra. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the error factor will depend on the type of apparatus being used. For each type of apparatus, the error factor can be determined using factor analysis. This can be done by assuming that only the error factor changes between apparatuses. Alternatively, all four factors can be recalculated for each type of apparatus. Alternatively, the error factor can be ignored and only three-factor analysis can be employed. The inventors additionally extended their research assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to five factors. The inventors concluded that either three-factor analysis or four-factor analysis gives the best results. Table 1 shows the data points which can be used to recreate the reflectance spectrum for each factor for both three-factor analysis and four-factor analysis.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is a flow chart of the steps involved in changing the color of hair in accordance with preferred embodiment of the invention. First, (block <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) a customer chooses a desired hair color from a selection of possible hair colors. The possible hair color selection is typically created by measuring the reflectance spectrum for a large sample of different colored hairs. Each reflectance spectrum is then inputted into a computer. The computer uses the reflectance spectrum to recreate the actual color for displaying on a monitor. The displaying of a color on a monitor based upon a reflectance spectrum is known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the desired colors could be printed on a card or be represented as swatches of dyed hair. Therefore, each of the available colors has a known reflectance spectrum. Second, (block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) an initial reflectance spectrum of the customer&apos;s hair is measured by reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Third, (block <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) the contribution of the natural hair factors to the initial reflectance spectrum is analyzed by the computer. In other words, the coefficient of each natural factor contributing to the initial reflectance spectrum is determined by the computer, typically using a curve fitting program which performs iterative calculations based on the known natural hair factors and the initial reflectance spectrum. By way of a non-limiting example, instructions that can be used to write a computer program to perform coefficient analysis are given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Fourth, (block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) the computer performs hypothetical calculations based upon hypothetical hair treatments to determine a hair treatment which results in a final reflectance spectrum which is as close as possible to the reflectance spectrum of the desired color. In this step, the computer calculates the change in the coefficients of each of the natural hair factors due to a hypothetical bleaching time and a hypothetical application of a dye or a combination of dyes. The effect of bleaching on the natural hair factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>The effect of dyeing on the natural hair factors using a dye which has a factor which is dissimilar to one of the natural hair factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The effect of dyeing on the natural hair factors using a dye which has a factor which is similar to one of the natural factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Dyes that have a very high correlation with the natural hair factors of Eumelanin and Pheomelanin are described as natural hair factor dyes. Natural hair factor dyes can be used when the desired hair color is a natural hair color. When a dye is introduced, a new factor associated with that dye is typically introduced as well. After the computer calculates the new coefficients of the factors, the computer calculates a new reflectance spectrum (block <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>), based on the hypothetical hair treatment, by summing the new contribution of each factor. In other words, the computer calculates a new reflectance spectrum, based on the hypothetical hair treatment, by summing the products of the reflectance spectra of each factor and their associated coefficients. This new reflectance spectrum is then compared with the reflectance spectrum of the desired color (block <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). The computer then performs many iterative calculations until the difference between the new reflectance spectrum and the desired reflectance spectrum is minimized, given the constraints of the iteration process and the available dyes. An exact match is generally not possible due to the constraint of the available dyes. In other words, the computer calculates a hair treatment based on the desired reflectance spectrum given the constraints of the iteration process and the available dyes. It should be noted that if the desired hair color is a natural hair color, then dyeing using synthetic dyes may not be needed, bleaching may be enough. Likewise, if a customer has light colored hair, bleaching may not be necessary to achieve the desired color. Fifth, (block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) after the computer has completed the iterative calculations, the computer displays the colors of a selected number of possible final hair colors. The possible final hair colors generally include the closest match to the desired hair color as well as several other colors, which are a set gap from the desired color. The set gap can be preset by the hairdresser. Sixth, (block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) the customer chooses one of the available final hair colors. Seventh, (block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) the computer informs the hairdresser of the required bleaching time and dyes needed to achieve the chosen color. Eighth, (block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) if bleaching is required, the hairdresser bleaches the hair for the required time. Ninth, (block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> optionally at this stage, steps two to seven (line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>), or steps one to seven (line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>), are performed again, before dyeing to achieve more accurate dyeing results. Tenth, (block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) if dyeing is being performed, the hairdresser dyes the hair using a dye or a combination thereof. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other methods using the technology of the present invention are possible. For example, the above steps may be performed in a different order. Also, the customer could be given a number of hair color choices based on the use of a specific dye with differing bleaching times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, the inventors have proven by experimentation that the factors of unbleached natural hair are very similar to the factors of bleached hair. Additionally, the inventors have proven that a bright natural hair has substantially the same coefficients of factors as a dark hair that has been bleached to the same color as the bright natural hair. Additionally, the bleaching process is mainly reducing the Eumelanin&apos;s concentration within the hair, but the pigments of Pheomelanin are also being removed. Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is a graph showing the weight of Eumelanin against effective bleaching time. The following analysis was performed using 4-factor analysis. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following analysis can be performed for any number of factors. The weight of Eumelanin is given by the following formula:

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the weight of the Eumelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the Eumelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>PH </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the Pheomelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the white factor and C<highlight><subscript>ER </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the error factor. If three-factor analysis is used, the error factor is ignored. Similarly, the weights of the other factors are calculated with respect to the coefficients of all the factors. The graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was produced by performing the following steps. A reflectance spectrum of a sample of hair was measured and then W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was calculated. The sample of hair was then bleached for a specific time. The same sample of hair was then additionally bleached again and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated. The same hair was then re-bleached and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated a number of times. This same process was repeated for a number of hair samples. The bleaching substance used is a mixture of 50% water, 25% Mon-platin Blondy hair bleaching powder and 25% Mon-platin 12% oxygen cream, by weight. The bleaching substance is manufactured by Alef Meshi Industries Ltd., 4 Pinkas David Street, Rishon Le-Zion, Israel. Equations 2 to 6, which are listed below are based on experiments performed with the abovementioned bleaching substance. A new reflectance spectrum was measured and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated. All the sequences were merged into a single graph by supplying the appropriate time-shift for each sequence of dots for each hair sample. For example, a hair sample having an initial weight of the Eumelanin factor 0.6 starts at an effective time of approximately 30 minutes (line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>), another hair sample having an initial weight of the Eumelanin factor of 0.4 starts at an effective time of approximately 57 minutes (line <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>). Therefore, by way of example, if a hair sample has an initial W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>of 0.6 and the hair sample is bleached for 70 minutes, the hair sample will have a final W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>of approximately 0.2. This is because the hair sample has an effective start time of 30 minutes and an effective end time of 100 minutes. Additionally, by way of example, if another hair sample has an initial weight of Eumelanin of 0.4, this hair sample has an effective start time of approximately 57 minutes. If this hair sample needs to be bleached to have a weight of Eumelanin of 0.2, which is equivalent to an end time of 100 minutes, then the hair sample needs to be bleached for 43 minutes (100 minutes less 57 minutes). The equation of the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was then calculated using a best-fit method. The equation of the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> where t<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the effective bleaching time in minutes for the Eumelanin factor. Equation 2 is valid for any hair sample using the abovementioned bleaching solution. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that equation 2 can be recalculated by performing limited experiments using another bleaching substance on a sample of hairs. In order to determine the appropriate equations for another bleaching substance, the samples for used should be from natural unbleached hairs. Hair samples from at least five individuals should be used. Each sample of hair from the same individual should be divided into several smaller samples so that each smaller sample can be bleached for a different duration of time. This procedure is repeated for each individual. All the results are merged together into the same graph by supplying the appropriate time shift to each series of points from each individual. The samples used should be chosen such that, the samples give a large spread over the range of possible natural hair colors (from bright hair to dark hair). The total number of points on the graph should be at least 15. It should be noted that only the constants of equation 2 change with different bleaching substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the Pheomelanin factor also decreases due to bleaching. However, when a reflectance spectrum is measured and the coefficients of the reflectance spectrum are analyzed, the coefficient and therefore the weight of the Pheomelanin factor only represent the Pheomelanin that is in the background of the Eumelanin. In other words, the dark nature of the Eumelanin pigment prevents a portion of the Pheomelanin factor from contributing to the reflectance spectrum. Therefore, the coefficient and weight of the Pheomelanin factor which are calculated using the analysis of the reflectance spectrum only represent a &ldquo;background&rdquo; value. Similarly, the coefficient and weight of the white factor which are calculated using the analysis of the reflectance spectrum only represent a &ldquo;background&rdquo; value with respect to the foreground Eumelanin. Therefore, W<highlight><subscript>PH&minus;B</subscript></highlight>, which is the weight of the Pheomelanin factor in the background is given by the following equation:

First a reflectance spectrum of a sample hair is measured (block <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). Second, the coefficients of the factors are analyzed by the computer (block <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>). Third, the weights of the factors are calculated, by the computer, using equation 1 and the equivalents of equation 1 (block <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>). For the Eumelanin and the Pheomelanin factors the initial effective time is determined using equations 2 and 4 (block <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). Fourth, the computer suggests a bleaching time (block <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>). Fifth, the computer calculates the final weight after bleaching of the Eumelanin factor using equation 2 and the final weight after bleaching of the Pheomelanin factor using equations 4 and 5 (block <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>). Sixth, the computer then converts the final weights after bleaching into final coefficients after bleaching (block <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>), as will be explained below. At this stage the final coefficient of the white factor is calculated directly from the final weight of the Eumelanin factor, as will be explained below. Seventh, the computer determines a final reflectance spectrum after bleaching by summing the product of each factor with the factor&apos;s final coefficient after bleaching (block <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

It should be noted that the coefficient of the error factor is not effected by bleaching or dyeing and therefore the known coefficient of the error factor for the apparatus concerned can be used in equations 7, 8 and 9. Alternatively, if three factor analysis is used the error factor can be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the above equations are used to calculate the effects of bleaching on the reflectance spectrum of hair when the hair is of normal quality, that is the hair cuticle is not tightly closed and not abnormally open. However, when the cuticle of the hair is open more than average or closed more than average, the hair is bleached quicker or slower, respectively, and therefore requires less or more bleaching time, respectively. Therefore, the above formulas need to be adjusted for any change in bleaching time due to the condition of the cuticle. It is estimated that the bleaching time needs to be adjusted between 5% and 50% due to the status of the cuticle. Experienced hairdressers are skilled in the art of detecting inferior quality hair, which is associated with the status of the cuticle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, dyeing hair generally alters the weights of the natural hair factors as well as adding a new factor of the dye itself. The final weight of the dye is a function of the sum of the changes of the weights of the natural hair factors, as shown by the following equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>DYE&minus;F </subscript></highlight>is the final weight of the dye, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the change in the Eumelanin factor due to dyeing, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>PH </subscript></highlight>is the change in the Pheomelanin factor due to dyeing, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the change in the white factor due to dyeing and &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>ER </subscript></highlight>is the change in the error factor due to dyeing. For the sake of clarification, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is equal to the final weight of the Eumelanin factor less the initial weight of the Eumelanin factor. Similarly, all the changes in weights and coefficients of the various factors are defined as the final value less the initial value of the weight or coefficient of the factor concerned. It should be noted that the effect of the change in the weight of the error factor on the weight of the dye is generally negligible and can be ignored. Moreover, if three-factor analysis is used the error factor is also ignored. The weight difference of the Eumelanin factor is correlated with the change in the coefficient of the white factor divided by the initial weight of the weight factor among the background. This is illustrated by the following equation:

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Additionally the final weight of the dye factor is highly correlated with the final coefficient of the dye factor. This is illustrated by the following equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>EU&minus;i </subscript></highlight>is the initial weight of the Eumelanin factor, W<highlight><subscript>PH&minus;i&minus;B </subscript></highlight>is the initial weight of the Pheomelanin factor among the background. Therefore, it can be seen that limited experimentation for each dye or a combination of dyes can be performed using a number of hair samples to determine the functions of equations 10 to 14 for each dye or combination of dyes. The limited experimentation involves calculating the coefficients and weights of all the factors before and after dyeing. The results are then plotted on suitable graphs and the functions of equations 10 to 14 are determined by the equations of the slope of the graphs. For example, the function of equation 10 is determined by plotting a graph of W<highlight><subscript>DYE&minus;F </subscript></highlight>against (&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>PH</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>ER</subscript></highlight>). The determined equations, for a specific dye, or combination of dyes are used to predict the change on the reflectance spectrum by applying the dye or combination of dyes, as will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The hair samples should be from natural unbleached hairs. Hair samples from at least five individuals should be used. Each sample of hair from the same individual should be divided into several smaller samples so that each smaller sample can be bleached for a different duration of time. Each sample is then dyed. This procedure is repeated for each individual. The samples used should be chosen such that, the samples give a large spread over the range of possible natural hair colors (from bright hair to dark hair). The total number of points on each graph should be at least 15. It is advisable to apply the dye according to the manufacturer instructions using the correct concentrations and waiting times. If the manufacturer instructions are not followed, the dye needs to be applied consistently to ensure that results obtained are meaningful. When a combination of dyes is used the proportions of each dye needs to be carefully maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The factor of the dye or combination of dyes is determined by two methods. The first method involves dyeing white hair with the chosen dye or combination of dyes. A reflectance spectrum of the dye or combination of dyes is measured and factor analysis is performed to identify the new factor associated with the chosen dye or combination of dyes. White hair is preferred as the coefficients of the Eumelanin and Pheomelanin factors are very small and the factor analysis is quicker. The second method includes placing a thick dried droplet of dye or combination of dyes on window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The reflectance spectrum of the thick droplet of dye or combination of dyes only contains the contribution of the factor of the chosen dye or combination of dyes and therefore the factor of the dye or combination of dyes is easily identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> By way of a non-limiting example, experiments were performed using the WELLA KOLESTON 305/0 Light-Brown dye. This dye is produced by Wella AG, Berliner Allee 65, 64274 Darmstadt, Germany. The dye was applied in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. The color tube was packaged with an oxygen cream. The entire contents of the color tube and oxygen cream were mixed together to form the dye. The following equations, based on equations 10 to 14, are valid for the abovementioned dye:

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that other dyes have equations, which have a similar form to equations 14 to 19, but with different constants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is a flow chart of the steps involved in determining the effects of dyeing on the reflectance spectrum of hair. First, if bleaching is to be performed the final weights after bleaching are used as the initial weights before dyeing. If bleaching is not performed or actual bleaching has already been performed on the customer&apos;s hair, a new reflectance spectrum is measured and the coefficients and weights of the new reflectance spectrum are analyzed and calculated, respectively (block <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>). Second, final coefficient of the white factor is calculated using equation 14 (block <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>). Third, the final weight of the Eumelanin factor, after dyeing, is calculated using equation 11 (block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). Fourth, the final weight of the Pheomelanin factor, after dyeing, is calculated using equation 13 (block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). Fifth, the final weight of the dye is calculated using equation 10 (block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). Sixth, the final coefficient of the dye is calculated using equation 12 (block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). Seventh, the final coefficients of the Eumelanin and Pheomelanin factors are calculated using algebra and equations 7 to 9 (block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). Finally, the final reflectance spectrum after dyeing is determined by summing the product of each factor with the factor&apos;s final coefficient after dyeing (block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, when there is a very high resemblance between the spectrum of the chosen dye and one of the natural hair factors, the method described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> becomes impractical. This is because the very high resemblance between the dye and one of the natural hair factors requires a very high resolution during the searching process of the curve fitting program to be enable identification of the coefficients of the dye factor and the closely matched natural hair factor. Therefore, another method is needed to predict the effect on the reflectance spectrum of hair due to dyeing, where the dye factor has a very close resemblance to one of the natural hair factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> One method is to merge the final weight of the dye factor and the closest natural hair factor. By way of example, when the dye factor is very close to the Pheomelanin factor, the following relationship is valid:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> where &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the change in the weight of the white factor due to dyeing, W<highlight><subscript>W&minus;i&minus;B </subscript></highlight>is the initial weight of the white factor among the background, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the change in the weight of the Eumelanin factor due to dyeing, C<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the final coefficient of the white factor and W<highlight><subscript>W&minus;F </subscript></highlight>is the final weight of the white factor. Therefore, it can be seen that limited experimentation for each dye or combination of dyes can be performed using a number of hair samples to determine the functions of equations 20 to 23 for each dye or combination of dyes, as described above with reference to equations 10 to 14. The limited experimentation involves calculating the coefficients and weights of all the factors before and after dyeing. The results are then plotted on suitable graphs and the functions of equations 20 to 23 are determined by the equations of the slope of the graphs. The determined equations, for a specific dye or combination of dyes, are used to predict the change on the reflectance spectrum by applying the dye or combination of dyes, as will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. It is advisable to apply the dye according to the manufacturer instructions using the correct concentrations and waiting times. If the manufacturer instructions are not followed, the dye needs to be applied consistently to ensure that results obtained are meaningful. When a combination of dyes is used the proportions of each dye needs to be carefully maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> By way of a non-limiting example, experiments were performed using the WELLA KOLESTON 307/64 Cherry dye manufactured by Wella AG. This Cherry Dye has a very high resemblance to the Pheomelanin factor. The dye was applied in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. The color tube was packaged with an oxygen cream. The entire contents of the color tube and oxygen cream were mixed together to form the dye. The following equations, based on equations 20 to 23 are valid for the abovementioned dye:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> If the factor of the chosen dye has a similar factor to the Eumelanin factor, then the final reflectance spectrum after dyeing will be very similar to the Eumelanin factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Natural hair factor dyes, dyes that have a very high correlation with the natural hair factors of Eumelanin and Pheomelanin, are created by mixing existing dyes so that the combination of dyes exhibits a reflectance spectrum which is very close to the Eumelanin or Pheomelanin factor, respectively. Natural hair factor dyes are used when the desired final color is a natural hair color. Limited experiments are performed with different proportions of the natural hair factor dyes to determine the dyeing equations for these different proportions. The computer calculates a hair treatment by performing iterative calculations using the equations for the different proportions of the natural hair dyes. It is advantageous to use natural hair factor dyes, as a new factor is not introduced into the hair by the dyeing process. Therefore, the computer iteration process is quicker. Then the natural hair factor dyes can be used to dye hair to a natural hair color. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to resonant drive systems for power toothbrushes and similar appliances, and more specifically concerns such systems having a rotational motor with a spring coupling arrangement from the motor to an output element, such as a brushhead. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Power toothbrushes are in general well known and encompass a wide variety of designs and physical arrangements. Some power toothbrushes have proven to be both effective and commercially successful. One example is the toothbrush shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,189,153, which is owned by the assignee of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many power toothbrushes have a rotary-type motion. Some have the capability of a 360&deg; armature rotation, but due to design arrangements produce an oscillatory movement limited to a particular range of motion, i.e. a selected arcuate portion of 360&deg;, in order to provide a more suitable brushing effect. Some of these rotary motion devices are mechanically driven, while others are resonant systems, involving a movable mass such as a brushhead structure and a spring which is attached to the handle. The resonant frequency of the system is affected by the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with resonant systems. Resonant devices, using a motor with a rotating armature, often have the advantages of design simplicity and reasonable cost, as well as generally a small size, but also have significant disadvantages, including vibration coupled to the handle of the device caused by the reversing action of the system as it oscillates back and forth through the selected arc, instead of rotating continuously through a 360&deg; rotation. The vibration is coupled to the handle through the spring element. The resonant frequency of such a system is affected by the moment of inertia (MOI) of the handle, as well as the other parts of the drive system. Performance of the device is also affected by the dynamics of the handle, such as damping, spring rate and moment of inertia. Further, when a user grips the handle of such a simple resonant system device, the user becomes part of the system, which further changes the dynamics of the handle and the resulting performance of the device. Thus, in a resonant system, many variables affect the dynamic characteristics of the handle and system performance. In addition, the spring coupling to the handle in a resonant system produces a significant physical vibration in the handle. These disadvantages have affected the commercial success of such toothbrushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is thus desirable to significantly reduce the physical vibration in the handle and the noise produced by such a resonant drive system as well as increasing the efficiency of such a system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a small appliance motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted in a housing or handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (shown split) of a power toothbrush <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although the present invention is described in the context of a power toothbrush for convenience of explanation and illustration, it should be understood that the system of the present invention could be used in other small appliances which drive other workpiece elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is driven in a rotational mode in response to an electrical current provided from a battery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a stator portion (not shown) of motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Battery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will typically be a rechargeable battery, recharged via a charging base (not shown) in which the toothbrush is positioned when not in use. Such a charging base arrangement, for instance, is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,796,325, which is also owned by the assignee of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> At the other end of the drive system from motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a workpiece element, such as a brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of this invention, brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can take various configurations. Brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted on an elongated shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which extends rearwardly from the brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to an output mass <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, located in housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The present invention, as indicated above, is a resonant system, one characteristic of which is that the drive system is driven by the motor at a frequency which is at or very close to the resonant frequency of the mechanical drive system. This increases the efficiency of the system, as well as providing other performance benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The resonant system of the present invention includes a spring assembly, shown generally at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which couples motor armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the output mass <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Bearings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> support the motor and the output shaft within the housing. Spring assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the embodiment shown comprises a helical spring which is divided into two series portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, separated by an intermediate node point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The two spring portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the embodiment shown are substantially equal, having spring constants k1 and k2, respectively. At node point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is located a mounting spring element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, also referred to a centering spring, which mounts, i.e. connects, the spring assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Mounting spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also has a small damping effect on the action of the spring assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As indicated, spring portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> typically comprise a single spring structure which includes a node region where the centering spring element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is mounted. The arrangement shown has the advantage of isolating the drive system from the housing, such that there is little or no vibration transmitted to the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The helical spring portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the embodiment shown could be different spring arrangements, including a wire-wrapped coil spring or leaf or beam springs, or a torsion element, again with a node point between two series portions thereof. The centering spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (with some damping effect) could be made from a number of different materials, including rubber, and could take various configurations, including a thick washer-like configuration. The centering spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, being positioned at the node point between the two spring portions, will not move substantially during operation of the device, and there will be very little or no vibration coupled from the drive system to the housing. The centering spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also insures alignment of the brushhead arrangement and the motor during operation of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In normal operation of the present resonant system, the drive frequency will be approximately equal to the resonant frequency of the drive system. In this mode, the brushhead portion is rotating 180&deg; out of phase with the motor. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, spring portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected at its far end to output mass <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which has a moment of inertia j2, which in turn is connected to brushhead shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a moment of inertia j1. The combination of brushhead shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a moment of inertia j3. In the embodiment shown, if the spring constants k1, k2 of the two spring portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are equal, and if the moment of inertia j1 of the motor armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> equals the sum of the moments of inertia of mass <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (j2) and the combination of the shaft and the toothbrush (j3), such that k1&equals;k2 and j1&equals;j2&plus;j3, the resonant frequency &ohgr; of the drive system will be approximately:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If the motor is driven in this mode (the resonant frequency mode), then the unloaded brushhead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will move through the same arc (the same brushhead amplitude) as the motor armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, but in the opposite rotational direction, i.e. 180&deg; out of phase, from the rotation of the armature. Operating the motor at the resonant frequency of the drive system will produce an efficient system, i.e. significant power is delivered to the brush element at the resonant frequency. Further, there is little or no vibration of the drive system coupled to the housing; i.e. the resonant drive system is isolated from the moment of inertia of the housing and also the user (by virtue of the user&apos;s grip, which can vary). The moment of inertia of the drive (armature) end of the system in the nodal mount arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> works against the moment of inertia of the driven (brushhead) end to produce this desirable vibration isolation effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> teaches two spring portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that the spring assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could be implemented with a single spring. In such a case, the node point is located approximately halfway down the length of the spring for the mounting of spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As indicated above, spring element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be made from various damping materials and is mounted directly to housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Spring element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be a torsional spring, having a spring constant of k3, connected between node point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Again, the torsional spring provides a centering (alignment) function for the motor and the load (brushhead). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Various alternatives to the above-described arrangement are possible. For instance, if it is desired that the amplitude of the brushhead or other workpiece element be different from the amplitude of the motor armature, the ratio of the moment of inertia for the armature (j1) and the total of the moments of inertia for the output mass (j2) and the shaft and brushhead (j3) is made to be other than 1.0. The node point along the spring assembly will then occur at a point other than halfway along the length thereof. As one example, in order to have the brushhead have approximately half the amplitude of the motor amplitude, j1&equals;0.5 (j2&plus;j3) and k1&equals;0.5 k2. Other selected values of spring constants and moments of inertia will result in other amplitude ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, it may be desirable to have a vibration effect which is noticeable to the user at selected times in the use of the toothbrush, for instance, after a certain period of use time (e.g. 2 minutes). This requires that the device operate in a different torsional mode, referred to as a vibration mode. In this mode, the rotation of the brushhead end of the system is in phase with the rotation of the drive (motor) end of the system, working against the handle. This vibration mode of operation results when the motor frequency (the drive signal) has a frequency which is significantly different than the resonant frequency of the coupling system. The frequency at which this happens for a particular system can be determined by one skilled in the art. The device is programmed such that when an event occurs which is to be signaled to the user, such as a timer signal, the drive frequency is changed so that the device operates in its vibrational mode. In this mode, as noted above, significant vibration from the drive system is coupled to the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through centering spring element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This coupling of vibration to the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provides a physical indication (feedback) to the user of the occurrence of selected operating conditions, such as time of use or brushing pressure, measured by other portions of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the nodal mounted system of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>. This other embodiment uses a torsional element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, instead of a spring assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The torsional element is stiff in all directions except for one, the desired twisting or rotational action. While a U-shaped channel is shown as an example of such a torsional member, other cross-sectional shapes could be used, such as for instance a V shape, or other cross-sectional shape. The V shape mass may have some advantage over the U shape in mounting to the motor and brushhead portions of the system. In the embodiment shown, the respective ends of the torsional element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are mounted in elastomeric end pieces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. A mounting shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extends from elastomeric end piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Mounting shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> supports a brushhead assembly (not shown) or other workpiece. Elastomeric end piece <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is positioned at the motor (drive) end of the device. The motor is represented at <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A extends from the armature of the motor so that the motor end of the device can be supported to the housing. Mounting shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A are supported by elastomeric support elements <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The support elements provide radial and rotational alignment for the device as well as support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The support elements are fixed to their associated shaft/pin members. In operative action, cage members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> hold the outside portions (surfaces) of the support elements fixed, while the inner portion of each support element attached to the shaft winds up in a spring-like fashion by virtue of the rotation of the armature shaft. This arrangement, when driven at the resonant frequency of the drive assembly, results in the armature rotating in one direction while the brushhead shaft rotates in the opposite direction. A &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; node point occurs at a point along element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, with the vibrational torques applied to the housing by cage members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> effectively canceling each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that workpiece element motions other than rotational can be accomplished using a similar coupling spring approach to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For instance, a linear longitudinal motion of a brushhead or similar element can be produced using a compression spring which is operated in an axial mode. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> driving mass <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be moved linearly by means of various motor arrangements, which drives one end of the spring assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, resulting in a movement of the driven element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, i.e. the brushhead, with the movement of the driving mass. The driving mass and the driven mass thus will move in opposite directions. As with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is a specific point along the spring element which will not move during operation of the device. This is node point <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Similar effects can be produced using a spring and node point arrangement where a driving mass is moved laterally about the node point, which action is then transferred via the second portion of the spring to a driven mass. The two motions are 180&deg; out of phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the present invention, a motor is used to drive an armature through a selected amplitude or arc. The action of the armature is coupled to a workpiece element, such as a brushhead, through a coupling arrangement which in one embodiment comprises two torsion spring portions, which have a node point between them. Driving the system at the resonant frequency results in the workpiece element following the action of the armature, but approximately 180&deg; out of phase. Efficient power transfer also occurs to produce effective action of the workpiece element. In another embodiment a torsional element, such as a U channel or V channel, is used instead of a spring member, producing a virtual node at a point along its length. While the invention has been described in the context of a toothbrush, it should be understood that the same arrangement can be used for other small appliances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed here for purposes of illustration, it should be understood that various changes, modifications and substitutions may be incorporated without departing from the spirit of the invention, which is defined by the claims which follow.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Also, the toothbrush assembly according to the third aspect may be constructed such that the holding portion has contacts and is dividable in two parts, one housing the contact-type switch, and the other housing the sound generator, and such that the contact-type switch and the sound generator are electrically connected via the contacts when the two parts are coupled with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the toothbrush assembly according to the third aspect may be constructed such that the tooth-brushing portion is fitted into the tooth-brushing-portion support or fitted into and supported by the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since the toothbrush assembly according to the present invention has the above-described structure, in comparison to the conventional toothbrush assemblies, this toothbrush assembly with a sound generating function is more entertaining and interesting, and also provides more excitement to any user, in a wide age range from a child to an adult, in addition to encouraging a young child to brush his or her teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is, the toothbrush assembly according to the present invention has the contact-type switch which generates a pulse for every swing of the swingable contact in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement of a user, the counter or counting the pulses sent from the contact-type switch, and the sound generator for generating or stopping the generation of a voice message or a musical tone when the sum of the pulses counted by the counter reaches a predetermined value. With this configuration, encouraging messages, exciting musical tones, or the like can be easily sent and heard by a user who is brushing his or her teeth, thereby making the toothbrush assembly more entertaining and interesting than the conventional toothbrush assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Since the sound generator outputs different voice messages, musical tones or the like in accordance with different predetermined values reached by the sum of the pulses counted by the counter, the sound generator can easily send encouraging messages, exciting music, or the like in accordance with the number of tooth brushing movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The contact-type switch according to the third aspect detachably supports the end of the handle of the toothbrush assembly and has the swingable contact and the stationary ring contact. The swingable contact is attached to the tooth-brushing-portion support supported by the elastic packing member so as to be swingable relative to the hollow holding portion which houses the sound generator including the counter. Also, the swingable contact is inserted into the center of the ring of the stationary ring contact so as to contact the inner part of the ring when the tooth-brushing-portion support swings. The stationary ring contact and the swingable contact are both connected to the corresponding input terminals of the counter. Since the contact-type switch is constructed such that it generates a pulse and sends it to the counter when the swingable contact contacts the inner part of the ring of the stationary contact in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement, swings of the strongly shaken front part of the toothbrush assembly can be easily converted into pulses via the swingable contact attached to the tooth-brushing-portion support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the tooth-brushing-portion support is swingably fitted into and supported by the holding portion via the elastic waterproof packing member, the swings of the strongly shaken front part of the toothbrush assembly can be reliably transferred to the tooth-brushing-portion support. Also, the inside of the hollow holding portion is always hermetically sealed against water by the backing member even when the tooth-brushing-portion support is swinging. In addition, the contact-type switch can easily convert the foregoing swings into precise pulses via the swingable contact attached to the tooth-brushing-portion support. Furthermore, batteries housed in the holding portion can be easily replaced with new ones since the holding portion is dividable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Also, the toothbrush assembly may be constructed such that the counter is formed from a counter circuit which is activated by a pulse sent from, for example, the contact-type switch and counts clock pulses for a predetermined time period, for example, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> seconds, and such that the sound recording and play back unit is maintained to operate when the counter is activated again within 10 seconds. When the counter does not receive a pulse from the contact-type switch for 10 seconds, the toothbrush assembly stops outputting a sound and shuts off its power supply. In any case, sounds are generated in association with the movement of the swing-type or contact-type switch.</paragraph>

Since the stationary contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B are both connected to the input terminals of the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generates a pulse and sends it to the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B attached to the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> swings together with the handle in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement and instantaneously contacts the stationary ring contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The power supply controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed between the contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The power supply controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> makes the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> operative when the power switch is instantaneously closed upon the first contact of the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B to the stationary contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and also makes the controller inoperative when the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> does not receive a pulse for a predetermined time period. To be specific, the toothbrush assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is configured such that the sound generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> outputs a voice message, a musical tone, or the like when the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> repeatedly receives pulses for a predetermined time period, for example, at least 2 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a modification of the toothbrush assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having the foregoing improved contact-type switch according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Like parts are identified by the same reference numerals in the above-described embodiments and their detailed description is omitted. In this modification, in place of the fixing depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed at the top of the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a fixing projection <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a small diameter is formed at the top of the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having, for example, a rod-like shape so as to attach the end of the handle extending from the tooth-brushing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B to the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, the fixing projection <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is detachably fitted into a semispherical fitting portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which has a depression inside and which is formed at the end of the handle of the tooth brushing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the toothbrush assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment instantaneously closes the power switch for every swing of the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement of a user and thus generates a pulse. Alternatively, a pulse generating circuit (not shown) independent from the contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be disposed between the contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to generate, for example, a constant pulse having a rectangular waveform for every swing of the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, an example use and operation of the toothbrush assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment will be described. The handle of the tooth-brushing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B is beforehand attached to the fixing depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the tooth-brushing-portion support <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> elastically supported by the packing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> swings laterally relative to the longitudinal direction thereof in accordance with the tooth-brushing movement of a user after the tooth-brushing portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B has toothpaste thereon, the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B of the contact-type switch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> instantaneously contacts the inner part of the ring of the stationary contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Intermittent pulses are generated upon the repeated contacts in the above described manner and are sent to the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the power switch is closed upon the first contact of the swingable contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B to the stationary contact <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, the power supply controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> makes the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> operative so as to continue counting the pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the sum of pulses sent to the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> reaches one of the predetermined values, the sound generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> outputs a corresponding voice message or musical tone through the loudspeaker <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Since the way of outputting sounds such as voice messages or musical tones is the same as those in the above-described embodiments, its detailed description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Various modifications of the toothbrush assemblies described in detail in the foregoing embodiments can be made within the scope of the present invention. In particular, the way of generating sounds is not limited to the one in which the voice messages are output according to the predetermined jobs as described above, and the way of generating sounds can be modified in various manners, for example, in a manner such that music is output from the beginning of tooth-brushing and stops if the tooth-brushing is continuously performed for a predetermined time period, and subsequently such that a sound for evaluating the tooth-brushing performance is output. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a braces for push broom handles and more particularly a brace for reinforcing the attachment between a handle and head member of a push broom </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Push broom brushes typically comprise a handle member connecting to a head member. The head member further has a plurality of bristles protruding therefrom. With frequent use and especially in heavy industrial use, it is common for the handle to break at a portion near the connection to the head member. For a push broom where the handle member is permanently attached to the head member, the entire broom has to be discarded when the handle breaks. As such, push brooms commonly have a removable handle member with one end of the handle being threaded for engaging a threaded bore defined on the head member. A common inconvenience is that the handle can often become loose in use. Also with more frequent use, the tendency for the handle to become loose increases. Furthermore, frequent replacement of the handle can be expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To address the inconvenience and problem, braces for push brooms have been developed. The braces include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,922,179; 4,239,413; 5,568,668; and 5,337,440. The braces typically has a clamp portion attaching to the handle near the head member and a pair of brace rods connecting the clamp portion to the head member in a triangular pattern. None of the prior art teaches a brace as taught in the present invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is contrived to overcome the conventional disadvantages. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a brace for reinforcing the connection between the handle member and head member of a push broom. Furthermore it is an object of the present invention to prevent the loosening of the handle from the head member in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above-described objects, the brace according to the present invention comprises a flat elongated base member and an elongated tubular member connecting to a central portion thereof in a T-shaped manner. The base member is essentially rectangular in shape to conform to the shape of the top side of the conventional push broom. The tubular member defines a bore extending through the length of the tubular member and through the base member. The bore is adapted to receive a handle of a push broom therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For securing the elongated member onto the top side of the head member of the push broom, a plurality of apertures are formed through the base member and the tubular member so that threaded fasteners can extend through the holes and into the push broom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The base member and tubular member should be made of a durable rigid material for effective reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention is briefly summarized, the fuller understanding of the invention can be obtained by the following drawings, the detailed description and appended claims.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of bathing balls are commercially available. These bathing balls attract consumers by their unique outer appearances. These bathing balls commonly use a net or sponge matching with an ornamental body to cause a sense of beauty. The ornamental body has the function of absorbing applied bathing gel and causing applied bathing gel to produce bubbles when rubbed against the body. However, when directly rubbing the ornamental body against the body, it does not give a comfortable touch. Further, the ornamental body is inferior to the net in causing applied bathing gel to produce bubbles. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The gutter-shaped cleaning blade or brush has a hole which is the same size as that of the end of the pole so the pole can be inserted into the blade/brush (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The blade or brush has another hole that is perpendicular to the one mentioned above. The pole also has a hole on the end connecting with the blade/brush. A pin can be inserted into the hole on the blade/brush through the hole on the pole to pin the blade/brush on the top end of the pole after the user inserts pole into the blade/brush (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The blade or brush is shaped as the cross section of the gutter, but they are marginally smaller than the cross section of the gutter to facilitate easy and thorough cleaning. They can be moved smoothly inside the gutter to collect leaves and debris together. There are different blade and brush sizes, appropriate sized blades and brushes are used for different gutter sizes on different residences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The steps to assemble the tool set are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 1. Insert the pole into the blade/brush as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 2. Insert the pin into the hole on the blade/brush through the hole on the pole as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 3. Lock the pin with the hook on the pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The mounting direction of cleaning blade and brush can be easily changed as described in the steps below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 1. Unhook the pin and pull it out from the blade; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 2. Detach the blade/brush from the pole; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 3. Turn blade or brush 180 degrees and insert the pole into the blade/brush; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 4. Insert the pin into the hole on the blade/brush through the hole on the pole; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 5. Lock the pin with the hook on the pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Changing the mounting direction is to make the gutter-shaped blade or brush to fit the gutter well while the user is cleaning the gutter on both sides, because the cross section of the gutter has an asymmetric shape. One blade/brush side facing a user to clean the gutter on the left side of the user (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and mounting blade/brush of another side facing the user to clean the gutter on the right side (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The purpose of connecting the pole and metal pin with a string is to avoid losing the metal pin while the user is changing the mounting direction of the blade or brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The steps below describes how to clean a section of the gutter for one ladder position: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 1. A user usually locks the blade on the pole as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to collect leaves and debris in the gutter on user&apos;s left side, then removes them from the gutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 2. The user replaces the blade with the gutter-shaped brush to collect the dirt in the gutter and removes them. The brush should be mounted in the same was as the blade and the front side of the brush is facing the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 3. The user replaces the brush with the blade again, but this time, the user pins the blade on the pole as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to collect leaves and debris on the right side, and then removes them from the gutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 4. The user replaces the blade with the brush mounted on the pole to remove the dirt on the user&apos;s right side. The backside of the brush is facing the user now. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There is another small hole on the pole. The metal pin is tied to the pole though this hole by a string as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to avoid losing the metal pin while the user is changing the mounting direction of the blade or brush. Using a pin is only one of the ways to lock the blade/brush on the pole and there can be many other ways for the same purpose. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A wiper arm and method for manufacturing a wiper arm provides a body having a first end connectible to and supportable by a drive shaft for imparting oscillatory rotary movement and a second end connectible to and supporting a wiper blade. A torsional region of the body is capable of toggle action and is located between the first and second ends of the body. The toggle action is defined by two stable positions, a primary position and a secondary position, lying spaced at opposite sides of an unstable range of movement, where one of the two stable positions exerts downward pressure on the wiper blade connectible to the body for engagement against a windscreen to be wiped. The torsional region is defined by first and second torsional members initially formed in a relaxed state. Each torsional member has a free end cantilevered outwardly from the first end of the body and spaced from one another. Each torsional member is subsequently flexed into a flexed state such that the free ends engage one another. The free ends are connected with respect to one another by any suitable attachment method or fastener when in the flexed state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wiper arm for supporting a wiper blade for oscillatory rotary movement with respect to a windscreen and the method of making a wiper arm. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A wiper arm is connectible to a wiper blade and supports the wiper blade with respect to a windscreen to be wiped with a force or load acting to maintain the wiper blade in contact with the windscreen during the oscillatory rotary movement of the wiper blade across the windscreen even at high vehicle speeds. The wiper arm is securely attached at one end to a drive shaft for imparting oscillatory rotary movement to the wiper blade connected at an opposite end of the wiper arm. A wiper arm is typically movable from the primary position where the wiper blade is engaged against the windshield, to a secondary position where the wiper blade is spaced from the windscreen allowing routing maintenance and/or cleaning of the wiper blade assembly. These movement requirements of the wiper arm have led to conventional wiper arms being complex assemblies with many individual parts, which are costly to manufacture. Typically, two spring mechanisms have been required to provide the ability to move between the primary and secondary positions of the wiper arm. In some instances, the first spring mechanism is provided by the resiliency of the material of the wiper arm itself, while the other spring mechanism is provided by a separate coil spring. When using a separate coil spring, the wiper arm structure must be modified to at least partially enclose the coil spring to protect it from the elements. The head of the wiper arm typically engages a conventional splined cylindrical drive shaft using a rigid, matching splined socket adjacent one end of the wiper arm. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a method for manufacturing a wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is illustrated. The wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for oscillatory rotary movement with respect to a windshield or windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the first step as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed having a first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connectible to and supportable by a drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for imparting oscillatory rotary movement to the wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connectible to and supports a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for oscillatory rotary movement with respect to the windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A torsional region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed to be capable of toggle action defined by two stable positions lying spaced at opposite sides of an unstable range of movement. One of the two stable positions, such as a primary position of the wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> exerts downward pressure on the wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connectible to the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for engagement against the windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be wiped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method according to the present invention, the torsional region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is initially formed to be defined by first and second torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each torsional member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> when in a relaxed state <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has a free end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> cantilevered outwardly from the first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and spaced from one another. Subsequently, each torsional member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is flexed from the relaxed state <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a flexed state <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, so that the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> engage with one another. The free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are then connected with respect to one another when in the flexed state <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> according to the preferred method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The flexing step according to the method of the present invention preferably overlaps portions of the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with respect to one another. The connecting step according to the method of manufacturing a wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include the step of engaging a fastener <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through aligned apertures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the overlapped portions of the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An attachment member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be attached to the second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for supporting a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be connected thereto. In the preferred configuration, the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be formed of a composite material including cross-linked fibers to improve torsional capability of the wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A cross section of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and/or the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, can vary from the first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to achieve a desired initial load capability when in the flexed or bent state <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The entire assembly can be overmolded with a low modulus material if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A wiper arm according to the present invention, such as a wiper arm manufactured according to the method of the present invention, supports a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for oscillatory rotary motion with respect to a windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The wiper arm includes a body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connectible to and supportable by a drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for imparting oscillatory rotary movement thereto. The second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connectible to and supports a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A torsional region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is capable of toggle action and is located between the first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The toggle action is defined by two stable positions, such as a primary position and a secondary position, lying spaced at opposite sides of an unstable range of movement. One of the two stable positions, such as the primary position of the wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> exerts downward pressure on a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connectible to the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for engagement against a windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be wiped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the preferred configuration of the wiper arm according to the present invention, the torsional region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is defined by first and second torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> initially formed in a relaxed state <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Each torsional member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a free end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> cantilevered outwardly from the first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and spaced from one another. Each torsional member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> subsequently is flexed into a flexed state <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> engage one another as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connects the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with respect to one another when in the flexed state <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the torsional region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes overlapping portions of the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with respect to one another. The connecting means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can include a fastener <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> engagable through aligned apertures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed in the overlapped portions of the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An attachment member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is attachable to the second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for supporting a wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be connected thereto. The torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are preferably formed of a composite material including cross-linked fibers to improve torsional capability of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A cross section of the body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and/or torsional members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, can be varied from the first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the second end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide a desired initial load capability, such as a desired preload force of the wiper blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the windscreen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the wiper arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the primary position. If desired, the entire assembly or body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be overmolded with a low modulus material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Wiper arms are becoming longer to enable the wiper system to cover the larger windshield areas caused by high glass angles. This causes higher inertia&apos;s and potential excess wiper pattern growth due the reversal accelerations. The composite material choice lowers the inertia and reduces the growth. This concept also has a non-linear load to maintain a near constant arm pressure and further has the ability to be pulled into a position away from the glass to be out of the way to manually clean the glass by hand. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when two pultruted shapes are placed parallel, diverging, or converging, and molded or bonded into place, the shapes exhibit beam deflection characteristics (similar to F&equals;K*X). The shapes, when viewed from the end of the arm, can be parallel or at an angle to one another. When the tips of the composite shapes are brought together with the blade attachment, and fixed together, the cross section as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> will twist causing a predisposition of deflection, biased either into the page or out of the page as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The present invention provides a biasing force that is different than the &ldquo;spring&rdquo; characteristics. In particular, the force at the end of the arm in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, will be zero in the primary and secondary positions, and is also zero just at the &ldquo;flip&rdquo; point between the primary and secondary positions. Therefore the arm will exhibit nonlinear force properties. When the arm is lifted to the out or secondary position, the arm stays in the out or secondary position, allowing the driver to manually clean the glass under the blade. The two pultruted shapes can be riveted or overmolded at the free ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The entire unit can be overmolded with a low modulus material like a reaction injection molded polyurethane. This overmolded material can be provided in any color desired and can be used to hide the washer delivery system. It should be noted that, pultrusion can be made with 45&deg; biased angle fiber material for extra torsional rigidity and for increased pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first and second torsional members can be set at an initial angle with respect to one another to create a bias toward one of the two stable positions. In any of the described configurations, the body and/or torsional members can be formed of composite materials, such as carbon fiber, steel, aluminum, or other suitable materials. The first and second torsional members can also be initially formed in a relaxed position having free ends relatively close to one another, where the torsional members are spread apart to the flexed position and held relative to one another. The connecting means can be a molded end piece holding the free ends of the first and second torsional members in a predetermined relationship with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to wheel constructions. It finds particular application in conjunction with a resiliently-coupled drive wheel assembly for a self-propelled vacuum cleaner, and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, it should be appreciated that the wheel constructions disclosed herein can find use in a variety of other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Self-propelled vacuum cleaners are well-known in the art. In a typical self-propelled upright vacuum cleaner arrangement, a transmission assembly associated with a floor nozzle assembly mechanically transfers rotational power from an electric motor to a drive axle. The drive axle supports powered or otherwise driven wheels at opposing ends thereof. The driven wheels are directly connected to or otherwise fixed for positive mechanical rotation with the drive axle. A control mechanism associated with the transmission assembly governs the direction of rotation of the drive axle, and hence, the direction of travel of the vacuum cleaner. The control mechanism is typically actuated by articulating or pivoting the upright handle portion of the vacuum cleaner relative to the floor nozzle to effectuate either forward or reverse travel of the vacuum cleaner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One problem associated with the illustrated drive arrangement is that when the upright handle portion is pivoted about the floor nozzle portion, the direct mechanically coupling of the electric motor output shaft to the drive wheels results in an abrupt or sudden start or acceleration of the vacuum cleaner in either the forward or reverse directions. Such &ldquo;jump starts&rdquo; can be disturbing to the user during a vacuuming operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it has been considered desirable to develop a new and improved drive wheel assembly for a self-propelled vacuum cleaner that meets the above-stated needs and overcomes the foregoing difficulties and others while providing better and more advantageous results. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a wheel assembly is disclosed for a vacuum cleaner that has a drive axle mechanically coupled to a drive source. The wheel assembly includes a drive member rotatably secured to the drive axle, a wheel casing at least partially surrounding the drive member, and a resilient coupling that establishes a rotational engagement between the drive member and the wheel casing after a predetermined amount of rotation of the drive member relative to the wheel casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a self-propelled vacuum cleaner is disclosed. The self-propelled vacuum cleaner includes a drive motor, a drive axle coupled to the drive motor, and at least one drive wheel assembly including a drive member rotatably secured to the drive axle, an outer wheel casing surrounding the drive member, and a resilient coupling that establishes a positive rotational engagement between the drive member and the wheel casing after the predetermined amount of rotation of the drive member relative to the wheel casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method is disclosed for propelling a vacuum cleaner that includes a drive motor, a drive axle coupled to the drive motor, and at least one drive wheel assembly having a drive member rotatably secured to the drive axle, an outer wheel casing surrounding the drive member, and a resilient coupling that establishes a positive rotational engagement between the drive member and the wheel casing after the predetermined amount of rotation of the drive member relative to the wheel casing. The method includes rotating the drive axle and the drive member while maintaining the outer wheel casing stationary for a predetermined period of time, and establishing a positive rotational engagement between the drive member and the outer wheel casing after the predetermined period of time has elapsed to cause the outer wheel casing to rotate.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exemplary upright vacuum cleaner housing A having an upright handle assembly B including a dirt holding chamber, and a floor nozzle assembly C. The upright handle assembly B is joined to the floor nozzle assembly C by conventional pivot means D. In the embodiment being described, the floor nozzle assembly C includes two powered or otherwise driven wheel assemblies <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and two non-powered wheel or caster assemblies <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. While the vacuum cleaner A is illustrated as being of an upright type, it should be appreciated by those of average skill in the art that the wheel construction illustrated herein can also be employed for use on canister-type vacuum cleaners, wet/dry vacuum cleaners, carpet extractors, etc., and in a variety of other wheeled environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a wheel housing cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be collectively referred to as an outer wheel casing. The wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed from a cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> disk-shaped end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Located on a free edge of the cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an annular flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> central aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends through the end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a bearing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment being described, the bearing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is an oil impregnated, sintered bronze radial bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed as a circular disk having a cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an outer surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an inner surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an annular slot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is defined in the inner surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>proximate the side wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the slot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped to accommodate the annular flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in an assembled state of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As such, the wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cooperate to enclose or otherwise surround the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a central aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends through the center of the wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a bearing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> such as an oil impregnated, sintered bronze radial bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally formed as a spool or reel with first and second disk-shaped end walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a reduced-diameter cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> located between them. As such, a circumferential channel or groove <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is defined in the member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Further, a central aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends axially through the member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> transverse groove or channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is defined in the first end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The transverse groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> communicates with the aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an arcuate or C-shaped (i.e. semi-circular) groove or channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is defined in the second end wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled to the wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a resilient coupling including a resistance means. In the embodiment being described, the resistance means takes the form of at least one, and preferably two or more, elastic members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> such as coil springs and the like. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each coil spring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes fastening means associated with each end thereof. The fastening means takes the form of inner and outer hook-shaped end portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, respectively of each coil spring. The inner hook portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of each spring is retained within the annular groove <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by a transverse pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that extends through corresponding apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> associated with each end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are spaced approximately 180&deg; apart. Likewise, the outer hook portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of each spring is supported by a transverse pin <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that extends through corresponding apertures <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> associated with the wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are also spaced approximately 180&deg; apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is mounted in an aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> associated with the wheel housing end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A free end of the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> projects into the arcuate channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> associated with the end wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in an assembled state of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the radial bearings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are axially aligned to rotatably support a drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the vacuum cleaner A. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> free end of the drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes a transverse notch <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that accommodates a drive pin or key <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> positioned within the channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> associated with the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the drive pin <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> transfers power from the drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during operation of the vacuum cleaner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in a &ldquo;resting&rdquo; or equilibrium state of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e. the drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is not applying rotational power to the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), there is minimal or no spring force generated by the springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the free end of the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is substantially centered along the length of the arcuate notch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the end wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Power is directly coupled from the drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, via the drive pin <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, when the vacuum cleaner drive control mechanism is actuated (such as by pivoting the vacuum cleaner upright handle portion C forward or backward relative to the floor nozzle portion B). During initial rotation of the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the depending arcuate notch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates relative to the stationary wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and the elastic members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are increasingly tensioned or otherwise stretched to apply a gradually increasing torque force to the outer wheel casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Continued rotation of the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> results in driving an end wall of the arcuate notch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into contact with the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> against a tension force generated by the elastic members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to effectuate a positive rotational engagement between the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The velocity with which the notch end wall impacts the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be controlled (i.e. reduced) by purposeful selection of the elastic characteristics of the elastic members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that the gradual application of torque results in a less abrupt acceleration of the vacuum cleaner. That is, a predetermined time period elapses from the instant that the drive control mechanism is actuated to the point that positive rotational engagement of the outer wheel casing is established. During this time period, the elastic members are gradually tensioned and a torque force is gradually applied to the outer wheel casing. Accordingly, actuation of the drive wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in response to an input from the vacuum cleaner drive control mechanism is controlled by i) providing a delay interval from the moment that the drive control mechanism is actuated, and ii) gradually increasing a torque force to the outer wheel casing to the point that a positive rotational engagement is established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is further recognized that a certain amount of backlash (such as with a clutch, etc.) can be designed into vacuum cleaner drive train (including the drive wheel assembly) so that when power to the drive axle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is suspended (such as when moving the vacuum cleaner drive control mechanism from a first drive position&mdash;such as forward&mdash;to a neutral position, or through the neutral position to a second drive position&mdash;such as backward), a centering force is generated by the springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The centering force causes the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to slightly rotate relative to the outer wheel casing thereby repositioning (i.e. centering) the inner arcuate channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> relative to the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a subsequent actuation of the drive control mechanism results in establishing a time-delayed and less abrupt engagement of the drive wheel assemblies <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that each of the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wheel housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wheel cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and associated pins <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be manufactured (e.g. molded, cast, turned, stamped, machined, cut, etc.) from suitable materials, such as a plastic material, a composite material, a resin material, a metal material, a wood material, etc. Further, the side walls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> defining outer wheel casing can include a textured (e.g rubberized) surface or a layer of tread material to improve the traction of the wheel assemblies <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized that suitable screws, bolts, nails, cotter pins, etc. can be used in place of any one or more of the pins <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are preferably formed from steel. It should also be recognized that resistance means other than coil springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be utilized to reduce the velocity with which the drive member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> impacts the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to establish positive rotational engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further, it should be recognized that if the tension forces generated by the stretched springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are strong enough, it is possible that a rotational connection between the drive member and the wheel housing can be established by the springs alone without the positive rotational engagement that is provided by the channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the wheel drive pin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In either case, as the springs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are increasingly tensioned, torque is gradually applied to the outer wheel casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of a driven wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, where reference numerals offset by a factor of <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are used to denote the same or similar components of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With particular reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and a wheel housing cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the wheel cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is collectively referred to as an outer wheel casing. The wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed from a cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a disk-shaped end wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that cooperate to define a contoured open cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. A central aperture (such as e.g. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) extends through the end wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and is sized and shaped to receive at least one of a radial bearing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a radial fluid seal <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> (in the case of one embodiment of the invention described further below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A plurality of projections <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are formed integral with the cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and extend radially inward from an inner surface thereof within the open cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in the embodiment being described, four projections <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are circumferentially-spaced approximately 90&deg; apart from each other to define four chamber portions <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> that generally converge at a central cavity portion <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. The width of each projection <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> tapers in a radially inward direction, and the side surface of each projection is shaped or otherwise contoured to define a land or seat <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the wheel cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed as a circular disk. A central aperture <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> through the cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is adapted (i.e. sized and shaped) to receive at least one of a bearing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> (such as an oil impregnated, sintered bronze radial bearing) and a second fluid seal <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). It is contemplated that the wheel cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can include a cylindrical side wall (e.g. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) with an annular slot (e.g. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that is sized and shaped to accommodate an annular flange (such as e.g. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the wheel housing to enclose and/or seal the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> within the housing cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the wheel cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can mate with a planar open end surface of the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and be positively secured thereto with conventional attachment means such as nuts, bolts, screws, adhesive, threads, etc. In both cases, a gasket (not shown) can be interposed between the wheel cover <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the open end surface of the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to provide a fluid-tight seal therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With continued references to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is generally formed as an impeller with a plurality of vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> extending radially outward from a central hub <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. A passage or aperture <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> extends axially through a side wall defining the central hub <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment being described, four vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are circumferentially-spaced approximately 90&deg; apart from each other. The width of each vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> tapers in a radially inward direction, and the side surface of each vane is shaped or otherwise contoured to define a land or seat <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in an assembled state of the Gwheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the fluid seals <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and/or radial bearings <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are axially aligned with the drive hub passage <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and rotatably support a drive axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the vacuum cleaner. The drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is rotatably secured to, or otherwise fixed for rotation with, the drive axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The drive axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can be splined, threaded, keyed, etc. to fixedly secure the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the wheel housing chamber portions <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> each accommodate a respective drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> while the central cavity portion <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> accommodates the drive member central hub <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. The drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is coupled to the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by a resilient coupling including at least one of a resistance means and a damping means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment being described, the resistance means takes the form of at least one, and preferably two or more (e.g. four), elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> such as coil springs and the like, and the damping means takes the form of at least one, and preferably two or more (e.g. four), damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> such as dashpots and the like. The damping means can also take the form of a fluid <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> within the cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In such as case, the seals <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> prevent such fluid from leaking from the cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that, within a specified operating range, the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> provide a directly proportional and substantially linear resistance versus displacement characteristic, whereas the damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> or damping fluid <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provide a directly proportional and substantially linear resistance versus velocity characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each of the at least one elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is interposed between the mutually opposed lands <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the wheel housing projections <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and drive member vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, respectively. It is contemplated that the lands <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> can be recessed or otherwise bored to retain respective ends of a coil spring. Alternatively, a retainer pin(s) <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can project from one or both lands <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to hold a coil spring in place between a projection <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and an adjacent drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. Likewise, each of the at least one damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is interposed between the mutually opposed lands <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the projections <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and drive member vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, respectively. It is contemplated that the lands <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> can be recessed or otherwise bored to retain respective ends of a damping member. Further, maintaining the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> in slight compression at a resting state of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> assists in maintaining the position of the respective elastic and damping members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> between the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be configured with at least two elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, or with at least two damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, or preferably, with a combination of elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. For instance, in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes four elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and four damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> with i) a first chamber portion <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> housing two elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> on opposing sides of a first drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, ii) a second chamber portion <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> housing two damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> on opposing sides of a second drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and iii) third and fourth chamber portions <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> housing an elastic member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a damping member <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> on opposing sides of third and fourth drive member vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a resting or equilibrium state of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. That is, the drive axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is not applying rotational power to the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, there are no tension forces and compression forces, or at least minimal and substantially equal tension forces and compression forces, generated by the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> such that the drive member vanes <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are substantially centered within the respective wheel housing chamber portions <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. A rotational force is directly coupled from the drive axle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> when the vacuum cleaner drive control mechanism is actuated (such as by pivoting the vacuum cleaner upright handle portion C forward or backward relative to the floor nozzle portion B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> During initial rotation of the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> located on the leading edge of each drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are compressed, while the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> located on a trailing edge of each drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are tensioned. Continued rotation of the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> results in gradually increasing the compressive and tensile forces acting on the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and/or the damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, and hence a gradually increasing torque force acting on the wheel housing until a positive rotational engagement between the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is established. This generally occurs when the rotational driving force acting on the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> overcomes the compressive and/or tensile forces generated by the elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and/or the damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Positive rotational engagement can occur when the leading edge elastic elements and/or damping elements are fully compressed, or can occur at some point less than full compression of the elastic elements and/or damping elements. In either case, the abruptness with which a positive rotational engagement between the drive member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is established can be controlled by purposeful selection of the elastic characteristics of elastic members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and of the damping characteristics of the damping members <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, actuation of the drive wheel assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in response to an input from the vacuum cleaner drive control mechanism is controlled by gradually applying a torque force to the wheel housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> over a predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the damping means can be a fluid within the housing cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In such case the level of damping provided by such fluid can be regulated by i) the viscosity of the damping fluid, and/or ii) throttling the flow of fluid within the cavity <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, such as through one or more channels <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> defined between the ends of each drive member vane <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of housing side wall <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and/or through one or more channels <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> defined between the ends of each housing projection <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and the drive member center hub <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description.

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the vacuum cleaner field, and, more particularly, to a vacuum cleaner having a reversible rotary agitator for propelling or drawing a nozzle assembly of the vacuum cleaner in a forward or rearward direction. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Upright vacuum cleaners and power head assemblies for canister vacuum cleaners in all of their designs and permutations have become increasingly popular over the years. Upright vacuum cleaners generally incorporate a nozzle assembly which rides on wheels over a floor surface to be cleaned and a canister assembly that is pivotally connected to the nozzle assembly. The canister assembly typically includes an operating handle that is manipulated by an operator to move the vacuum cleaner to and fro across the floor. The canister assembly also includes a dirt collection vessel comprising either a bag-like filter or a dirt cup that may include a cyclonic separation chamber and filter combination. The dirt collection vessel traps dirt and debris while substantially clean air is exhausted by an electrically operated fan that is driven by an onboard motor. It is this fan and motor arrangement that generates the drop in air pressure necessary to provide the desired cleaning action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In most upright vacuum cleaners sold today, a rotary agitator is also provided in the nozzle assembly. The rotary agitator includes tufts of bristles, brushes, beater bars or the like to beat dirt and debris from the nap of a carpet being cleaned while the pressure drop or vacuum is used to force air entrained with this dirt and debris into a nozzle housing of the vacuum cleaner. Power head assemblies for canister vacuum cleaners similarly include a rotary agitator in the nozzle assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In either the upright vacuum cleaner or the power head assembly, as the agitator rotates and engages the surface being cleaned, the agitator has a tendency to pull the nozzle assembly forward in accordance with its direction of rotation. The present invention utilizes the motion imparted to the nozzle assembly of the vacuum cleaner by a reversibly driven agitator to full advantage and to provide a vacuum cleaner that is self-propelled in both a forward and rearward direction. Such a vacuum cleaner works with the operator at all times and is easier to move to and fro across the surface being cleaned. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the purposes of the present invention as described herein, an improved self-propelled vacuum cleaner is provided. The vacuum cleaner includes a cannister assembly, a suction generator, and a nozzle assembly. The nozzle assembly includes a housing that defines an agitator cavity, an agitator mounted in the agitator cavity for rotation in a forward and rearward direction for propelling the nozzle assembly, and a drive motor for driving the agitator. An actuator for controlling operation of the drive motor and rotation direction of the agitator may be carried on either the cannister assembly or the nozzle assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, for example, a moveable hand grip is slidably mounted to a control handle for directing the forward and rearward rotation of the agitator and direction of movement of the nozzle assembly. As force is exerted on the hand grip by an operator, the hand grip slides along a stem of the control handle. A forward thrust moves the hand grip forward forcing the closure of a forward switch and the application of a voltage signal to a controller. Similarly, a reverse thrust exerted on the hand grip moves the hand grip rearward opening the forward switch and forcing the closure of a rearward switch and the application of a voltage signal to the controller. The status of the switches is monitored by the controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the controller is programmed to drive the drive motor in either of the first direction and the second direction upon receipt of a signal from the actuator. More specifically, the controller may be programmed upon a change of state of the actuator signal to remove power from the drive motor and to reapply power to the drive motor such that the agitator is rotated in a different direction. In one embodiment, the reapplication of power to the drive motor is delayed by the controller for between 0.1 second and 1.0 second to allow the agitator rotating in the first direction to slow significantly, if not stop, before power is reapplied to drive the agitator in the second direction and vice versa. In addition, the power reapplied to the agitator drive motor may be incrementally increased using a ramp or step function, or the like, to a normal operating level in order to reduce arcing and inrush current peaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the broadest teachings of the present invention, the vacuum cleaner described generally above may be an upright vacuum cleaner or extractor, or a canister type vacuum cleaner equipped with a power nozzle as are well known in the art. In either instance, the agitator drive motor may be positioned coaxially with the agitator including within the agitator. Alternately, the nozzle assembly may include a belt and pulley assembly or even a gear drive connecting a remotely positioned drive motor to the agitator as is also well known in the art. In addition, the canister assembly in either instance, includes a collection vessel comprising either a bag-like filter or a dirt cup that may but does not necessarily have to include a cyclonic separation chamber and filter combination. The collection vessel traps dirt and debris while substantially clean air is exhausted by an electrically operated fan that is driven by an onboard motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of propelling a nozzle assembly of a vacuum cleaner having a power driven agitator in a forward or rearward direction may be broadly defined as including the step of selectively rotating the agitator in a first direction to draw the nozzle assembly forward and in a second direction to draw the nozzle assembly rearward. The method may be alternatively described as including the steps of sensing operator input to determine a direction of desired nozzle assembly movement and driving the agitator to draw the nozzle assembly in the desired direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a vacuum cleaner includes a nozzle assembly including an agitator cavity and at least one rotary agitator mounted for rotation in the agitator cavity. That rotary agitator is rotated in a first direction for drawing the nozzle assembly forward and in a second direction for drawing the nozzle assembly rearward. The vacuum cleaner also includes a cannister assembly connected to the nozzle assembly, a suction generator, a drive motor for driving the at least one agitator, and an actuator for controlling operation of the drive motor and rotation direction of the at least one agitator. In accordance with the broad teaching of the present invention, the suction generator, the at least one agitator, and the drive motor may each be carried on one of the nozzle assembly and cannister assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the following description there is shown and described one possible embodiment of this invention, simply by way of illustration of one of the modes best suited to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modification in various, obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing a preferred embodiment of an upright vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. It should be appreciated that while an upright vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated, embodiments of the present invention also include different upright vacuum cleaners and canister vacuum cleaners equipped with a powerhead incorporating a power driven agitator such as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,474 which is owned by the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The upright vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pivotally connected to the nozzle assembly. The canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further includes a control handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A power switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided for turning the vacuum cleaner on and off. Of course, electrical power is supplied to the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a standard electrical wall outlet through a cord (not shown) as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the present preferred embodiment, the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is slidably mounted to a stem <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the control handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As forces are exerted on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by an operator, the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> slides along the stem <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as shown by action arrows A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A forward thrust moves the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forward toward the cannister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forcing closure of a forward switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the application of a voltage signal (Vcc) generated by a power supply (not shown) to a first pin of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a reverse thrust exerted on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves the hand grip rearward away from the cannister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> opening the forward switch and forcing closure of a rearward switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the application of the voltage signal (Vcc) to a second pin of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Dependent upon the desired direction of movement of the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as indicated by the open/closed states of the forward and rearward switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the voltage signal (Vcc) generated by a power supply (not shown) is selectively applied to the first or second pins of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in turn generates an output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) which is applied to and directs the operation of relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the present preferred embodiment, the electrical power is converted from AC to DC by converter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The DC power is applied to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such that the motor is rotated in a first direction for drawing the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forward or in a second direction for drawing the nozzle assembly rearward depending upon the open/closed states of the switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the controller is programmed to monitor the open/closed states of the switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and to generate the output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) which operates relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> accordingly. The controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is further programmed to remove the DC power provided through relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the drive motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to reapply power to the drive motor such that the agitator is rotated in a different direction upon a change in state of the switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In other words, when the operator of the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> desires to change the direction of movement of the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by actuating the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> generates a different output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) causing the removal and reapplication of DC power to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, the reapplication of power to the drive motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is delayed by the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for between 0.1 second and 1.0 second to allow the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rotating in the first direction to slow significantly, if not stop, before DC power is reapplied to drive the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the second direction and vice versa. It should be noted that the DC power reapplied to the agitator drive motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be incrementally increased using a ramp or step function, or the like, to a normal operating level in order to reduce arcing and inrush current peaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A pair of rear wheels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (partially shown) are provided at a lower portion of the cannister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a pair of front wheels <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are provided on the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Together, these wheels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> support the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for movement across the floor. To allow for convenient storage of the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a foot latch (not shown) may function to lock the canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in an upright position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. When the foot latch is released, the canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be pivoted relative to the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manipulated to-and-fro to clean the floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the present preferred embodiment, the canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a cavity adapted to receive and hold a collection assembly or vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A detailed description of the dust collection vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present preferred embodiment may be found in PCT Application PCT/US01/47401, entitled Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner with Filter and Filter Sweeper, filed Nov. 13, 2001. Although described as accessible from the front of the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the noted PCT application, the dust collection vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may likewise be accessible from the rear of the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the broad teaching of the present invention, the dust collection vessel may alternatively include a bag-like filter to receive dirt and debris as is also well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further carries a suction generator or fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and suction fan drive motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Together, the suction fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and its cooperating drive motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> function to generate a vacuum airstream for drawing air, dust, dirt and debris from a surface to be cleaned through the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the collection vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. While the suction fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and suction fan drive motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are illustrated as being carried on the canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it should be appreciated that one or both could likewise be carried on the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a nozzle housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that defines an agitator cavity <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that receives a rotating agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> shown is rotatably mounted in the agitator cavity <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and driven by a motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and cooperating gear drive <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the present preferred embodiment, the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and gear drive <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are coaxial with and housed within the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as is described in greater detail below (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). While the vacuum cleaner of the present preferred embodiment is described with the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> positioned coaxially with and held within the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the motor could be positioned outside of the agitator in either the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing a drive arrangement incorporating a belt and pulley assembly and/or a gear drive assembly in any manner desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the scrubbing action of the rotary agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the negative air pressure created by the suction fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and drive motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> cooperate to brush and beat dirt and dust from the nap of the carpet being cleaned and then to draw the dirt and dust laden air from the agitator cavity <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the dust collection vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the dirt and dust laden air passes serially through a suction inlet defined by the nozzle housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and hose and/or an integrally molded conduit in the nozzle housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and/or canister assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as is generally known in the art. Next, the dirt and dust laden air is delivered into the dust collection vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which serves to trap the suspended dirt, dust and other particles inside while allowing the now clean air to pass freely through to the suction fan <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and ultimately to the environment through an exhaust port <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which show the mounting of the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and associated gear drive <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> coaxially with and within the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in detail. As shown, the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is mounted for rotation relative to the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Specifically, a first end of the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes an end cap <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is supported on bearings <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on a stub shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> held in mounting block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> keyed into slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the side of the nozzle housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. An end cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at the opposite end of the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is supported on bearings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> mounted on the housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As should be appreciated, the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is fixed to the nozzle housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by means of the mounting block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> fixed to the motor housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and keyed in the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in the side of the nozzle housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> drives a shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> including gear teeth <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extends through a bearing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> held in the hub <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In the most preferred embodiment a fan <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is keyed or otherwise secured to the distal end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes three stub shafts <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that each carry a planetary gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Each of the planetary gears <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> include teeth that mesh with the gear teeth <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the planetary gears <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> mesh with the teeth of an annular gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the agitator motor housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by pin or other means. Thus, it should be appreciated that as the drive shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is driven by the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the planetary gears <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are driven around the annular gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> also includes a drive ring <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and associated rubber drive boot <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> which includes a series of spaced channels <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> that receive and engage axial ribs <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> projecting inwardly radially from the inner wall of the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rotation of the planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is transmitted by the drive ring <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and drive boot <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> directly to and causes like rotation of the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The rubber drive boot <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> provides the necessary damping to insure the smooth transmission of power to the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously with the rotation of the planetary gear set carrier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the drive shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also drives the fan <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at a ratio of between 4-1 to 10-1 and most preferably 6-1 with respect to the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The resulting rapid rotation of the fan <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> helps to move air through the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and ensure proper cooling of the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during its operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In operation, the operator applies a force to the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> dependent upon a desired direction of movement of the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If the force exerted on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in a forward direction, the forward switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is closed through contact with the hand grip and the voltage signal (Vcc) is applied to the first pin of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in turn generates an output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) based on the open/closed states of the switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which is applied to and directs the operation of relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In the present scenario with a forward force applied to the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, DC power is applied to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is driven in the forward direction drawing the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Conversely, if the force exerted on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in a rearward direction, the rearward switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is closed through contact with the hand grip and the forward switch remains open or is opened. In response to the output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> operates to direct the DC power to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is driven in a rearward direction drawing the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rearward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Once the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is rotating, a change in direction initiated by the operator, i.e., a change in the force exerted on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is indicated to the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by the forward and rearward switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, respectively. If the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is being driven in a forward direction and the operator exerts a rearward force on the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the hand grip travels along the stem <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the control handle allowing the forward switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to open followed by the closure of the rearward switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As the forward switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> opens, the voltage signal (Vcc) is removed from the first pin of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> thus changing the controller input. As the rearward switch closes, the voltage signal (Vcc) is applied to the second pin of controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> again changing the controller input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Based on the new states of the forward and rearward switches <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> stops generating the present output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) thus turning the relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> off and removing power from the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may then generate a new output signal (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) either immediately or after a delay period which actuates the relay <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to direct the DC power to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is driven in the rearward direction. The delay established by the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be between 0.1 second and 1.0 second to allow the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rotating in the first direction to slow significantly, if not stop, before DC power is reapplied to drive the agitator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for movement in the second direction and vice versa. In this manner, overheating of the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be substantially avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of this invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, various pressure sensing devices may be utilized to replace the forward and rearward switches which sense changes in direction initiated by an operator, or a single switch may be utilized to sense a change in direction with the agitator rotating in a normally forward direction. Additionally, different delay timing patterns may be utilized during a stop, delay, and restart sequence or application of the DC power to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be incrementally increased over a period of time. Even further, additional switching devices such as a FET array, for example, activated by the controller output signal may be utilized to direct the DC power to the agitator motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The vacuum cleaner could also be equipped with multiple agitators rather than a single agitator as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally and equitably entitled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a caster device for attachment to a first and a second member of a frame. More specifically, the present invention relates to a caster device for attachment to a first and a second member of a frame, the members being disposed angularly relative to each other to define a corner of the frame. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a caster wheel assembly. It is generally known to provide various caster wheel assemblies for cabinets, particularly, heavy cabinets. Typically, prior caster wheel assemblies are bolted directly to a frame for the cabinet. Some prior caster wheel assemblies utilize snap type holding systems for attachment to the frame. One problem with using such devices is the cost associated therewith. Another problem with using such devices is that adverse forces, such as when a cabinet is dropped, may be transferred to the fastener thereby damaging the article and/or fastener. Thus, for at least these reasons, there is a need for a new and improved caster wheel assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,324,724 to Reilly, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a caster wheel assembly. The subject invention includes, among other things, certain improvements to the device of the Reilly Patent. A pair of front tabs are used to locate the top plate with respect to the corner of the frame. The tabs inhibit the top plate from undesirably moving as a result of the interference with the frame. A pair of interlock tabs also locate the top plate relative to the frame to inhibit the top plate from moving, but the interlock tabs are also adapted to take more load. The interlock tabs are provided with a protruding hook like shape that is adapted to fit or even lock into place with respect to the frame. A pair of small screws, preferably self-tapping screws, are used simply locate the assembly relative to the frame. The tabs, primarily the interlock tabs, support the assembly so that loading forces can be transferred back to the frame and not the screws, thereby providing a more stable and robust assembly. It is noted that the receiving holes in the assembly for the screws can be slightly oversized to allow the assembly to float under load so as to further minimize any possible damage to the screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of the present invention to provide a caster device that overcomes the problems associated with the prior art arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the present invention is the provision of a caster device that is reliable in use and that is relatively low in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of the present invention is the provision of a caster device that is stronger and more capable of withstanding shock than prior art arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description, claims and drawings in which like numerals are used to designate like features.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to industrial caster wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Industrial caster wheels are used, for example, as stabilizer casters on a pallet truck. Such pallet trucks have a single drive wheel and one industrial caster wheel on each side. Usually, the industrial caster wheel has a spring member that absorbs shocks while traveling. The spring member also provides stability as the object to which the industrial caster wheel is attached travels over rough surfaces. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional industrial caster wheels use mechanical springs. The spring member is limited in travel due to bottoming out, which occurs due to poor shock absorbing characteristics. Previous efforts to replace mechanical springs with elastomeric members has generally been unsuccessful. These previous industrial caster wheels have used torsional elastomeric elements. However, these torsional-elastomeric-member-type industrial caster wheels have experienced significant performance degradation as the torsional elastomeric member abrades with usage. This abrasion occurs due to sliding contact with a housing for the torsional elastomeric member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention provides an industrial caster wheel assembly that has an improved life span. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that has an improved spring response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that has an elastomeric member that acts as both a spring and a damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that requires fewer parts to provide the spring response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that allows the height of the industrial caster wheel to be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that allows the height of the industrial caster wheel to be adjusted by one to two inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This invention separately provides an industrial caster wheel that allows a preload pressure applied to an elastomeric member to be adjustable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments of the industrial caster wheel according to this invention, an industrial caster wheel assembly includes a base member and a housing that supports the base member. The base member has an upper surface and a lower surface. The industrial caster wheel also includes a wheel that has an adjustable wheel axle that supports the wheel about a first axis. The industrial caster wheel has a number of side plates. Each of the side plates has an inside wall facing the wheel. At least some of the side plates engage the wheel axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A pivot axle is supported by at least some of the side plates and extends through the housing and those side plates. The pivot axle rotates about a second axis. The industrial caster wheel has a suspension assembly. The suspension assembly has an adjustable axle that extends through the housing and at least some of the side plates and an elastomeric support member and a plate. The elastomeric support member resists pivot movements of the side plates that tend to push the pivot axle toward the base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The industrial caster wheel also includes an adjustment member that adjusts a position of the adjustable axle relative to the elastomeric support member. As such, the preload pressure applied to the elastomeric support member is adjustable. Also, when the adjustment member adjusts position of the adjustable axle relative to the elastomeric support member, the adjustable axle also moves the side plates relative to the housing. As such, the height of the caster wheel assembly is adjustable as the slide plates moves relative to the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In some exemplary embodiments, the adjustable axle compresses the elastomeric support member by contacting the plate at approximately the midpoint of a first dimension of the elastomeric support member. </paragraph>

However, it should be appreciated that the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be of any desirable shape or dimension so long as the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provides the desired deflection and/or desired deflection response. This desired deflection response is described in greater detail below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes an adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a bolt <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> having a washer <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a head <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that engages a first one of the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the bolt <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> extends through a hole <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> formed in the first one of the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, through the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, through the opposing hole <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> formed in the second one of the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A nut <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and a washer <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are screwed onto the bolt <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and tightened against the outside surface of the plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A tab <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> can be placed on the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. If used, the tab <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> resists movement of the elastomer support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is compressed when the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> contacts the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In various exemplary embodiments, the adjustable axle contacts the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at approximately the midpoint of a first dimension of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can contact the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at any appropriate location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> each includes a plurality of holes formed in the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The locations of the holes can be chosen so that the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> rotates around the pivot axle <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The locations of the holes can also be chosen so that the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> compresses the variably shaped elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In operation, the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> rests against a surface ground and rotates about the wheel axle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The wheel assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> deflect by rotating about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the pivot axle <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also rotate by rotating about the axis <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Suspension is provided as the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allows one of the wheel assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the mounting base <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to rotate about the pivot axle <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> compresses the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by contacting the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> thus acts as a spring suspension and damper that resists the upward movement by accommodating shock loads due to impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the height h and the width w of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the height H and the width W of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be effectively rotated relative to the wheel <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that by rotating the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be narrowed according to the respective dimensions of the height h and the width w of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and thus allow a smaller turning radius about the pivot axle <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph plotting a number of different deflection to load response curves. In various exemplary embodiments, the desired deflection response can be similar to the curve A shown in the deflection/load graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The curve A demonstrates a decreasing deflection rate with an increasing load that causes the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to reach full deflection. However, it should be appreciated that the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can reach full deflection under any load in order to accommodate elevation restrictions while avoiding hard mechanical stops or &ldquo;jarring&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the desired deflection response can be similar to curve B shown in the deflection/load graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The curve B demonstrates a linear deflection over a large deflection range. However, it should be appreciated that as the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> dampens the applied load, the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> remains steady as the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> smoothly compresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the desired deflection response can be similar to the curve C shown in the deflection/load graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The curve C is the same as the curve B, except that the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a lower compression modulus. As a result, for the curve C, the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also offers a larger deflection under similar loads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the desired deflection response can be similar to the curve D shown in the deflection/load graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The curve D shows an increasing deflection with an increased load. It should be appreciated that the curve D can be achieved by changing the location of the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> relative to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, so that the direction of force of the adjustable axle varies as the deflection increases. It should also be appreciated that, in the desired deflection response illustrated by the curve D, the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> offers stiff response for small loads and allows for an increasing deflection rate as the load increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be formed from an elastomeric material having a hardness of approximately 50 Shore A to approximately 70 Shore D. In various exemplary embodiments, such an elastomeric material can be rubber or polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the elastomeric material forming the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can have a compression modulus of between around 650 psi and 5000 psi. However, it should be appreciated that any combination of one or more elastomeric materials having any combination hardness of that material and compression modulus of that material, where the combination of hardness and compression modulus provides a desired deflection response and/or range, can be used to form the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be designed to have a resilience, as measured by Bayshore Rebound, that is between about 20% and about 80%. However, it should be appreciated that the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is not limited to this resilience range. The rebound for the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be chosen to provide a desired amount of damping, mechanical resistance, or energy dissipation. In general, low rebound materials provide high damping or high energy dissipation, while high rebound materials provide a low damping or low energy dissipation. Thus, depending on the damping and energy dissipation requirements, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate how to select an appropriate material for the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the height and width of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be chosen so that the compressive force applied to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> does not exceed about 30% of the compression modulus of the combination of the one or more materials forming the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that maximum compressive force to be applied to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is not limited to this range of the compression modulus, so long as the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a reasonably useful life. In various exemplary embodiments, limiting the maximum compressive force applied to the elastomeric support member in this way reduces the strain on the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This in turn reduces the susceptibility of the elastomeric material forming the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to fatigue failure due to the compressive force to be applied to elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In various exemplary embodiments, a typical range of the compressive force applied to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is between about 50 psi to about 900 psi. However, it should be appreciated that the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be used when the compressive force to be applied to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extends outside of this range in either direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the width-to-height ratio of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be chosen to ensure that the maximum strain on the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> does not substantially exceed a desired maximum strain. The desired maximum strain can be determined by the required deflection of the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In various exemplary embodiments, the maximum desired strain is between about 5% and about 50%. In this case, the desired width-to-height ratio of the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is between about 0.5 to about 2.0. However, it should be appreciated that neither the maximum or desired strain on, nor the width-to-height ratio of, the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is limited to these ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, as shown, for example, in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the height of the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be adjusted by using an adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that includes at least an adjustment member. By adjusting the height, the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be adjusted for tire wear or to accommodate height variation in the equipment that is used on the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of one exemplary embodiment of an industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to this invention that includes one exemplary embodiment of an adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to this invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that includes the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> before a height adjustment is performed. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that includes the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> after a height adjustment has been performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment of the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes an adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as the adjustment member and an adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that is attached to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> extends through a hole (not shown) in the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and through the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and is aligned such that the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can come into contact with the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In various exemplary embodiments, the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is attached to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> by any known or later developed attachment method. In other various exemplary embodiments, it is not necessary to attach the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to the housing. In various other exemplary embodiments, the hole in the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is threaded to accept the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In this case, the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can be omitted. Thus, it is not necessary to use the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In various other exemplary embodiments, the adjustment member of the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is a stepped beam which extends through a hole in the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and is locked in position by one of the steps coming into contact with an interior surface of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In various other exemplary embodiments, the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a sleeve attached to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and a rod that passes through the sleeve as the adjustment member. In this case, in various exemplary embodiments, the rod is held in place by a set screw that passes through the sleeve and bears against the rod. In various other exemplary embodiments, the inner or outer surface of the sleeve is threaded, such that a compression nut can be screwed onto the sleeve to form a compression fitting around the rod. Of course, it should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, the sleeve can be replaced with any other structure usable either to hold a set screw or onto which a compression nut can be mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In still further exemplary embodiments, the sleeve can be provided with one or more sets of opposing holes. In this case, the rod can be provided with one or more correspondingly placed passages such that a retaining member can be inserted through one of one or more sets of holes in the sleeve and one of the one or more passages in the rod to hold the rod in a given position relative to the sleeve and thus to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the adjustable axel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In various exemplary embodiments, the sets of holes and the passages are each provided at different spacings to provide a broad range of relative positions between the sleeve and the rod at which the rod can be held. In various exemplary embodiments, the retaining member can be a cotter pin or the like. In various other exemplary embodiments, the rod can be provided with an axially extending pin or equivalent extension member. In this case, the sleeve can be provided with an elongated slot having steps or detents at which the extension member can be held. The relative position between the rod and the sleeve can then be adjusted by moving the rod relative to the sleeve such that the extension member is held at a different detent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In still other exemplary embodiments, the sleeve can be omitted, with the rod provided with a number of axially extending extension members. In this case, the hole in the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through which the rod extends can include a slot through with the extension members can pass when the rod is in the correct position. In this case, the position of the rod relative to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be adjusted by aligning the extension members with the slot and moving the rod in or out of the hole. Once the desired relative position is obtained, the rod is then rotated so that one of the extension members bears against the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to hold the rod in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In various other exemplary embodiments, the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can include stepped slots extending along the side of the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> instead of the holes <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In this case, in various other exemplary embodiments, the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is held in place by one of the stepped slots. In this case, the adjustment member an be implemented using any currently-available or later-developed device and/or structure that can move the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> into any one of the stepped slots. Of course, it should be appreciated, in various exemplary embodiments, the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be adjusted such that the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is held at a variably fixed position by the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In other exemplary embodiments, the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be pulled. In this case, the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> extends through a hole at one end of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the elastic support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and other end of housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> has a ring (not shown) aligned such that the ring comes into contact with the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As such, the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be pushed or pulled depending on the side of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in which the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In other exemplary embodiments, the adjustment member of the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can come into contact with the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at one or more positions located outside of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or outside of the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that any known or later developed structure that is able to move the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> relative to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and that can hold the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the moved position relative to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be used to implement the adjustment assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> By rotating one of the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> or the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in a first direction, the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is moved in a first direction toward the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to press the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> toward the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. By moving the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> toward the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> compresses the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by contacting and bearing or pressing against the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, by moving the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> toward the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the pivot axle <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is also rotated relative to the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> such that the height of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is also reduced. The adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the pivot axle <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> rotate together because, as discussed above, both are fixed to the side plates <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As such, the height of the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be adjusted by at least one or two inches, depending on the design of the industrial casting wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, by moving the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> toward the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the preload stress applied to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can also be increased by moving the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> toward the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that hard mechanical stops or &ldquo;jarring&rdquo; can be further avoided by applying a predetermined amount of preload stress to the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. By applying a predetermined amount of preload stress, the response time in which the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> accommodates shock loads is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> By rotating one of the adjustment bolt or the adjustment nut <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in a second direction, the adjustment bolt <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is moved away from the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the preload stress applied by the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on the elastomeric support member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by contacting the plate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is reduced. Also, the height of the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is increased. However, it should be appreciated that the industrial caster wheel assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could also be modified so that moving the adjustable axle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> toward and way from the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> does not also reduce and increase the height of the housing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments outlined above, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention involves a four (4) wheel trolley used in a track and trolley system which allows the trolley to move smoothly along a track, bear and carrying heavy movable wall panels, and minimize the stacking depth of the movable wall panels when such panels are stored. The trolley includes trolley discs that define an outer circumferential groove. The outer circumferential grooves allow the trolley discs to maintain a lubricant reserve so that the trolley discs may move smoothly along the track. While the trolley may carry heavy loads, because of its relatively small size, the trolley minimizes the stacking depth of movable wall panels in their storage positions. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of the present invention pertains to movable wall panel systems that are used to partition large rooms into smaller rooms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Movable wall panel systems find useful application in a variety of venues, such as classrooms, offices, convention centers and hospitals. In these venues, the movable wall panels can be utilized to efficiently divide or compartmentalize an interior space into a multitude of separate, smaller rooms. These systems typically include an overhead track and trolley suspension system. The movable wall panels are connected to trolleys that roll within an overhead track. Travel of the trolleys within the track allows the panels to be moved between a stacked arrangement in a storage location, and a wall-forming, extended arrangement in alignment with the overhead track. Trolleys play an important role in movable wall panel systems because they transport the weight of the movable wall panel and provide movement through the track to take the movable wall panel from a first point to a second point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One type of movable wall panel system is a single panel system. In a single panel system, individual wall panels are stored in a stacked position in a remote pocket of the venue in which the system is being used. When the single panels are actually in use, they are extended from their stacked position and carried by a pair of trolleys to their wall-forming, extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because single panel systems are often used in conference and convention facilities, the systems must be suited to accommodate tall, wide and heavy movable wall panels. The trolleys used in these single panel configurations must be capable of bearing and carrying heavy loads. For this reason, one type of trolley frequently used in single panel systems is an eight (8) wheel trolley. Eight (8) wheel trolleys normally have large bodies for suspending and carrying heavy movable wall panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One problem with the use of eight (8) wheel trolleys or other trolleys with similarly large bodies is the amount of storage space needed to house the panels in a stacked arrangement. As described earlier, the single wall panels in a single panel system are stored in a stacked fashion in a remote pocket of the venue in which the panels are being used. In this way, the trolleys are stacked against one another. Due to the large trolley bodies necessary for bearing heavy loads, the stacking depth of the pockets in which the single panels are stored is quite limited. This shortage of stacking depth forces any venue using such single panel systems to either spend more money to increase the depth of its storage pockets or to use a smaller number of panels in the venue&apos;s single panel system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A problem is further created when smaller trolleys are used in single panel systems in an attempt to increase the stacking depth of the movable wall panels in storage. Because the trolleys are smaller in size, the trolleys can neither bear the load of heavy wall panels nor carry the heavy wall panels to their extended orientation. Even further, the use of smaller trolleys prove to be ineffective when carrying the heavy movable wall panels at higher heights. If an attempt is made to increase the heights in which the smaller trolleys may be used, the load-bearing capacity of the trolleys is compromised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another problem exists when a trolley&apos;s discs are not adequately lubricated. A lack of lubrication to a trolley&apos;s discs places a larger burden on the track on which the trolley moves. Subsequently, the trolley not only moves roughly along the track, but in doing so, the trolley may also damage the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The prior art includes an example of lubricating rollers, specifically those that form part of the roller chains of conveyors. In this example, the rollers include chambers with radial partitions extending inwardly across the chambers from the outer periphery of the rollers to the outer surface of bushings to which the rollers are attached. The radial partitions define lubricant passages, and the bushings have lubricant holes which are adapted to communicate with the rollers&apos; lubricant passages. When lubricant falls onto the radial partitions of the rollers, the lubricant is guided by the lubricant passages to the bushings, whereupon it lubricates the bushings and then passes through the bushing&apos;s lubricant holes to the pins to which the bushings are mounted. The pins are then lubricated as well. In this way, every part of the roller chain is lubricated. A shortcoming of this prior art is that it does not teach how to effectively lubricate the surface of the rollers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The trolley of the present invention reduces the stacking width and provides versatility in adapting to track structures. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the track of the track and trolley system includes a pair of bottom flanges extending longitudinally inward from the track&apos;s walls, and the bottom flanges are horizontally displaced from each other to define a channel between them. Each of the bottom flanges defines a disc-supporting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the trolley includes a trolley body which has first and second axle members having opposite ends. The axle members are positioned within the trolley body in a rotational manner so that they may rotate within the trolley body. The trolley includes four (4) trolley discs which are rotationally attached to each end of the two axles, respectively. The trolley discs enable the trolley to move along a track. Each of the trolley discs define an outer circumferential groove. The outer circumferential groove enables the trolley discs to maintain trolley wheel lubricant so that the trolley moves smoothly along the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the trolley is used in conjunction with a track having a limited disc-supporting bottom surface. This track includes a pair of longitudinally extending bottom flanges that are horizontally displaced from each other to define a channel. Each of the bottom flanges project inward from the track&apos;s wall and define a bottom disc-supporting surface. Each of the bottom flanges further define a vertically contoured lip member, and each of the lip members define a second disc-supporting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The trolley used with the limited disc-supporting bottom surface includes four (4) discs, each of which define a first region and a second region. The radius of the second region is greater than the radius of the first region by about the height of the lip member. In this way, the trolley has greater support along the track having vertically contoured lip members. The first region of the trolley discs defines an outer circumferential groove. The outer circumferential groove enables the trolley discs to maintain trolley wheel lubricant so that the trolley moves smoothly along the track. </paragraph>

Trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> move on track <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are suspended from and carried by trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment of the present invention, track <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forms a continuous housing about trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Track <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes track walls <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and bottom flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> projecting longitudinally inward from track walls <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Bottom flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> define disc-supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on which trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> move. Bottom flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are horizontally separated to form channel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> consists of trolley body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, through which two rotational axle members <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are horizontally positioned. Attached to each end of rotational axle members <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is one disc of trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> each define outer circumferential groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Outer circumferential groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used to accept and to maintain lubricant (not shown) applied to trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> move on disc-supporting surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of bottom flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are capable of maintaining a lubricant reserve within outer circumferential groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> move smoother on track <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> than trolley discs that are not capable of maintaining such a lubricant reserve. Extending down from trolley body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> though channel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is trolley carrier <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Trolley carrier <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is attached to movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and allows trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to carry movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along track <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in the stacked position in which trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are stored. A top view of the orientation of trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in their stacked position is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a length L<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. As can be seen, when movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are in their stacked position, trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are aligned in a linear fashion. Movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a stored position, have stacking depth D. In this way, stacking depth D is in part determined by length L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be more effectively stored, as trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a length L1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a length L2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) (eight &lsqb;8&rsqb; wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is two four &lsqb;4&rsqb; wheel trolleys used in combination). L1 of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is smaller than L2 of eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For this reason, stacking depth D of multiple trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a storage position is less than the stacking depth of the same number of eight (8) wheel trolleys <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in storage. Since trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> both have the same load bearing capacity, it is advantageous to use trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a track and trolley system because the use of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reduces stacking depth D without decreasing load bearing capacity. The compact design of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the enhanced load bearing and lubricant features of discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> provide these advantages. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrates stacking depth D of movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are carried by trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and are stored in a stacked arrangement on both sides of stacking switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Stacking depth D is a function of the number of movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., as the number of movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> increase, stacking depth D increases. Stacking depth D is also a function of the respective sizes of trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., as the sizes of trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and/or movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> decrease, stacking depth D decreases as well. In accordance with the present invention, trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of four (4) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are thicker than the trolley discs of an eight (8) wheel trolley used in a comparable track and trolley system. However, because trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has one-half (&frac12;) the number of trolley discs as does the eight (8) wheel trolley, trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is smaller in overall size than the eight (8) wheel trolley. As explained above, as trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> size decreases, stacking depth D likewise decreases. Because four (4) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has thicker trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> than does the eight (8) wheel trolley and, hence, is smaller in overall size, trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is capable of bearing the same load as the eight (8) wheel trolley while reducing stacking depth D. In movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> utilizing trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention, stacking depth D is reduced by about twenty-five (25) percent in comparison to a stack of like number of movable wall panels in their stacked arrangement and supported by eight (8) wheel trolleys. This reduction in stacking depth D is based in part on the smaller size of trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the particular stacking arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, seventeen (17) movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are stacked to the left side of stacking switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and eighteen (18) movable wall panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are stacked to the right side of stacking switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With the use of four (4) wheel trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, total stacking depth T is approximately five and five-tenth (5.5) meters. By comparison, with the use of eight (8) wheel trolleys in movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, total stacking depth T is approximately seven and two-tenths (7.2) meters. In this way, the use of four (4) wheel trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reduces total stacking depth T by a little more than twenty-two (22) percent of total stacking depth T in movable wall panel system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that uses eight (8) wheel trolleys. The use of four (4) wheel trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in place of eight (8) wheel trolleys may reduce stacking depth T by at least twenty (20) percent and by as much as twenty-five (25) percent, depending upon the movable wall panel system in which trolleys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The size of trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is directly proportional to the load bearing capability of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> each have a diameter of fifty-seven and three-twentieths (57 and {fraction (3/20)}) millimeters. The diameter of trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is larger than that of typical trolleys with a load bearing capacity similar to that of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A typical eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a similar load bearing capacity as trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and used in a comparable track and trolley system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Trolley discs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> each have a diameter of about thirty-five (35) millimeters. In this way, although trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is smaller than eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, because trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are larger than trolley discs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is able to bear and carry about the same amount of weight as eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may bear up to about four hundred and seventy-two (472) kilograms. In this way, trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are each capable of bearing up to one-fourth (&frac14;) of trolley&apos;s <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> four hundred and seventy-two (472) kilogram load. That is, each of trolley discs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is capable of bearing up to approximately one hundred and eighteen (118) kilograms. By comparison, trolley discs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are not capable of bearing such a heavy load. Because eight (8) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of bearing about as much weight as four (4) wheel trolley <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each of trolley discs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is capable of bearing up to one-eighth (&frac18;) of trolley&apos;s <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> four hundred and seventy-two (472) kilogram load, i.e., fifty-nine (59) kilograms. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of sliding door assembly and installation. More particularly, the invention pertains to a novel floor support system for sliding glass or non-glass panels, that act as doors or room dividers, and to a system for supporting them on a floor-level track including means for draining off water that accumulates on the floor or on either side of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Traditional devices undergo change as our culture matures. The common door, mounted on hinges along one vertical side and arranged to swing through an arc, has given way in part to panels that slide on tracks and disappear into walls, sandwich with other such panels, spread apart to divide a room, or give access from one room to another. In many cases, a plurality of glass panels slides on a single track or on separate, but closely parallel, tracks to form a temporary wall, to divide a room into smaller rooms, or to provide an opening from one room onto a balcony, onto a patio, onto a swimming pool area and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A significant problem with these types of sliding panels occurs where one side of the panels faces outside the home or building toward the elements. Rain, sleet or snow hitting the glass and panel is drawn downward by gravity so that it puddles at the bottom of the panel and, when in great enough quantities, spills over onto the tracks upon which the panels are mounted for sliding movement. In other situations, the floor on one side of the track is slanted such that rain or melted snow runs toward the track. Once the moisture reaches the tracks, problems develop because of the many directions the moisture may flow. For instance, it sometimes flows under the panel and into a room wetting carpets and rugs that thereafter become stained, crispy, or develop an organic growth that causes bad odors and attracts insects. The moisture sometimes flows outward from the panel and stains concrete or causes deterioration of cement and wood flooring, or corrodes the glue that holds down floor coverings such as linoleum, parquet, and vinyl squares. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Often the moisture draws dirt, dust, small insects and bits of leaves and flowers toward the track system. Accumulation of this debris causes the wheels mounted on the panels to become harder to rotate and, in severe cases, seize and refuse to turn, making the panel difficult to move in its intended path. Cleaning these tracks is often difficult and all the debris is rarely removable due to the closeness of the tracks. Often, the panels must be removed and this can be a difficult task. In winter seasons, the moisture often freezes thereby anchoring the panel to its present position and eliminating the desirability of having slidable panels in the first place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In severe cases, the moisture puddles in the tracks and the subfloor on which the tracks are mounted is weakened. Concrete will crack under freezing and thawing of water and wood beams and wood floors can become weakened by constant exposure to water. Often, the mere beginning of such damage will cause tilting of the tracks and unbalancing of the load of the panels so that they refuse to slide easily along the tracks. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a system that will capture the moisture and convey it from the track system before such problems begin to develop. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention is an in-floor, adjustable, track assembly for sliding panels with a built-in weep system to collect and thereafter remove the moisture from the track area where, when installation is complete, the exposed surface of the track is minimal resulting in a smooth transition from interior to exterior. It is useful on single or multiple track systems in areas that are divided by the panels into an exterior or outside section and an interior or inside section. This system finds use where the tracks are mounted on a base, are single tracks or are in closely spaced-apart, parallel arrangement and extend upward from the base for engaging the undercarriage of at least two vertically-oriented panels in close arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention provides for splash guards arranged parallel to and spaced slightly apart from one side of each track, preferably the interior area, and forming, with each track, a channel with the base, for collecting moisture from the floor. At least one collection pan is mounted under each channel, to collect moisture from the channel, and includes a tube or other means to draw off the moisture from the collection pan to a distant location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Much of the invention is formed of extruded metal, such as aluminum, so that the cost of construction is minimized. Further, the invention is fully adjustable in vertical, as well as horizontal, directions so that it can be placed in new construction and installed in existing construction as well. Other parts are made of plastic and rubber so that the entire system is generally free from problems of corrosion even in the face of constant exposure to moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the main object of this invention is an in-floor, adjustable, track assembly for sliding panels with a built-in weep system that will remove moisture that flows across the floor, and possibly across the track, or that trickles down the sliding panels to puddle at the bottom thereof. Another object of the invention is a fully adjustable track assembly that may be adjusted to compensate for warpage, weakness, and misalignment of walls with floors to allow the panels to slide effortlessly over the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention will become more apparent when reading the subsequent Description of the Preferred Embodiment taken together with the drawings appended hereto. The scope of protection desired by the inventor may be gleaned from a fair reading of the claims that conclude this Specification.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, wherein elements are identified by numbers and like elements are identified by like numbers throughout the ten figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the in-floor, adjustable, single configuration track assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a sliding panel with a built-in weep system of this invention to comprise a narrow, elongated track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending upward from a base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, slightly above the top surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of finished floor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for engaging the undercarriage wheels <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of a panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (wheels <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are shown in phantom outline) and supporting panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while it is in motion, such as in rectilinear motion, on track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, it is preferred that track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is an upright, elongated, narrow-gauge metal plate forming an inverted &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape with base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a shaped top surface with small, lateral undercuts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for smooth engagement with wheels <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, that extend downward from the bottom of panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a stout perimeter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of metal or wood construction, panel inserts of glass or wood, and generally is quite heavy. It is preferred that track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> be extruded, such as from aluminum or other extrudable metal, in a single piece with base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Such extrusion further includes flanges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, extending outward from both sides of base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an in-floor, adjustable, multiple configuration track assembly for a plurality of sliding panels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (not shown), each with a built-in weep system of this invention, and shows a plurality of narrow, elongated tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in closely spaced-apart, parallel arrangement, each track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending upward from a separate base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for engaging and supporting the undercarriage of at least one panel on each track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while said panels are in motion, such as rectilinear motion, thereon. It is important to this invention that track top surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> protrudes or extends slightly above finished floor top surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to form a slight barrier to transverse flow of water or moisture across track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the exterior area to the interior area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an upright splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided for each of narrow tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, parallel to and spaced slightly apart therefrom a distance sufficient to capture moisture either dripping or running off panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, shown as drops <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, or running across finished floor top surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and over the top of track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the exterior area toward the interior area. Splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms, with each track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a narrow channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for collecting moisture from the bottom of each panel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When used herein, the term &ldquo;moisture&rdquo; means rain, sleet, snow, and water splashed from swimming pools, hoses and the like. Moisture is shown as angled straight lines in the exterior area in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are both upright, elongated, narrow-gauge plates and, together, form an inverted &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape with base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In addition, it is preferred that splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> terminates or &ldquo;tops&rdquo; at finished floor top surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the entire assembly is at or below top surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, except for a slight upward protrusion of track top surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and thus forms a very smooth, uninterrupted top floor surface. This configuration conforms to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C &sect;12100 et sec.). Since splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together form a substantially inverted &ldquo;T&rdquo; with base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that they all be extruded together in one monolithic piece from metal such as aluminum. If not possible, it is preferred that track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> be extruded as one piece and splash guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> installed, as shown, and soldered or otherwise rigidly mounted in base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A filter means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is located in said channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for preventing the ingress of debris. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>filter means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may take the form of a strip of highly reticulated plastic foam <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> cut and inserted into channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a piece of screen <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be cut and folded in a shape and slipped into channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Not only do these means prevent the ingress of debris while also not interfering with the collection of moisture, they also are easily removed so that they can be renewed without significant cost or effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, at least one collection pan <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is mounted under each channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and is accessible through at least one aperture <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> formed in the bottom of channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, preferably at the bottom of channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Collection pan <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> collects moisture that runs down into channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Collection pan <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is preferably made from plastic, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidine chloride, polyethylene, and the like, and can be easily injection molded to reduce the cost of production. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, collection pan <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> comprises enclosed sidewalls <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a closed bottom <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and an open top cavity <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> formed therein. Sidewalls <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are attached through gaskets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, along their top surfaces, to the bottom surface <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and cavity <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is preferably arranged directly below aperture <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to receive moisture as it drops from the panels into channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and through filter means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. An opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, preferably located in or near collection pan bottom <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is provided and egress means <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, such as a hose or tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, is attached thereto to draw off the moisture from the bottom of said panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in the Figures, at least two track support rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are provided, in spaced-apart arrangement, running transversely underneath tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, splash guards <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and bases <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extend outward, in orthogonal arrangement from track bases <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and each rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> includes a rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, defined by a bottom surface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and a top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. A pair of alignment clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided for each track, for assembly with rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to fasten each track to each rail. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the alignment between tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is orthogonal, i.e., each track is adjusted to be as close as possible to perpendicular from each rail. Each clamp <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a bottom clamp surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of which is shaped for overlapping contact with a curb <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed on track flanges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on both sides of track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is formed in track support rail body <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> opening upward through a slot <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> formed in rail body top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. An aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is formed in alignment clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for arrangement over upwardly opening C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>, clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are assembled with track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and track support rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> such that track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is overlaid rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>placed on rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, one on each side thereof, with portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of clamp bottom surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> overlaying flange <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with slot <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> aligned with aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A threaded means <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, such as a flat headed bolt or machine screw <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, is inserted down through aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, through slot <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and into a bolt-capturing nut <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> located in C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Nut <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is wider than slot <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> but smaller than the maximum internal width of C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> so that it is captured in groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> yet is slightly moveable therein. It is preferred that the outside diameter of bolt <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> be made slightly less than the width of slot <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to allow for some movement between bolt <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. This slight looseness allows track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to be adjusted horizontally in the floor on which track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be mounted and further allows track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to be brought as close as possible to orthogonal arrangement during assembly. It is preferred that bolt <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> have a flat heat with conical sides, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> in clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have a top chamfer to accept the flat bolt head so that the flat head of bolt <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> will lie flush with the top surface of alignment clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To aid the location of alignment clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of track support rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is preferred that a pair of upsets or curbs, <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>be formed in spaced-apart arrangement on track support rail top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> that, together, form a wide, substantially &ldquo;U&rdquo;-shaped depression <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> in rail top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Alignment clamps <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably made just wide enough to fit into said depression <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and aligned therein for assembly with track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to prevent the clamps from moving about when the assembly is subjected to the movement of panels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>, a side mounting tab <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is formed as an extension on the ends of track support rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. An adjustment/mounting slot <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed in rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, preferably at the center of C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and through the bottom of rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an elongated, slightly V-shaped indentation <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper surface of the bottom surface of groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and, preferably, along the center-line of rail bottom surface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for aiding in aligning a drill bit to drill through the bottom of rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in order to center the drill bit used in forming adjustment mounting slot <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in assembling tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on the surface wherein the panels are to slide, a first pair of threaded studs <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is mounted in the cement sub-floor <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> or in the wood sub-floor or other support surface, in spaced-apart arrangement, a distance equal to the distance between adjusting/mounting slots <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> that are formed at each end of rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and along an axis orthogonal to the axis of intended travel of the panels. Rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is then set down on studs <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and is shimmed to level. A first pair of bolt-capturing nuts <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is then placed in threaded engagement on studs <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and tightened down against that portion of rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> at the bottom of C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and fastened into place to provide rigid support for the entire assembly. Tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are then placed on top of rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and alignment clamps <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are placed on rail top surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, one on each side of track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and partially overlapping onto track flanges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Flat-headed bolts or machine screws <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are then inserted into clamp aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and passed down into threaded receipt in bolt-capturing nuts <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> that are first slipped inside C-shaped groove <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, in rail body <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Nuts <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> are then tightened down to rigidify the assembly. It is preferred that tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> be orthogonal or perpendicular to rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> when the full assembly is rigidified. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, collection pans <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, already mounted under rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are connected to hoses <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to be passed through holes in the sub-floor, preferably to an outside vent for removing the collected moisture from tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</cross-reference>, a trap <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may be located transversely between at least two adjacent tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that are in closely spaced-apart, passing arrangement, in order to collect the moisture that impacts the ends of panels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and runs down toward the underlying tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Panel perimeters <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> often are wide in order to support heavy panel inserts, such as glass panes and wood sheeting. This transverse thickness of the perimeter presents a rather broad surface for moisture to impact and trickle downward. Trap <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to comprise a pair of closely spaced-apart, parallel walls <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and a closed base <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> forms an open top U-shaped duct <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> therebetween. A pair of outwardly directed positioning slots <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed in base <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for sliding over inwardly-facing flanges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the two adjacent track bases <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Mounted along the top of wall <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is a pliable seal <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> for the purpose of contacting panel undercarriage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to seal trap <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> against leakage of moisture entering duct <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Filter means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as previously disclosed, may also be inserted in duct <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to prevent the ingress of debris along with the entrance of moisture. At least one collection pan <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is mounted under each transverse trap <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and is accessible through an aperture <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, located at the bottom of duct <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to pass moisture from duct <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> to an egress means <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, such as hose <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, as previously disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, sub-floor <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is thereafter encased, about its sides and underneath, with additional sub-floor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, in preparation of the laying of final or finished floor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that closes off a view of the invention except for a small upper portion of tracks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the very top of splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In some instances, splash guard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and narrow channel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be located on the exterior area of the assembly, however, it is preferred that they be located on the interior area of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiment of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof.

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A door hinge system enables a hinged door to be opened in multiple directions, not only at either lateral side, but also either forward or backward at either lateral side of the door, even though the system has a simple construction. In the door hinge system, when the hinged door is pivoted and opened from one lateral side, a hinge pin and at least one guide pin on the hinged door at the lateral side escapes from a hinge pin groove and a guide pin groove of a bracket assembly at the lateral side while a hinge pin at the other lateral side rotates on its own axis and a guide pin at the other lateral side is pivoted along a guide pin groove of a bracket assembly at the other lateral side. Each of the hinge pin grooves extend along an arc constituting a circumference of an imaginary circle whose center is positioned at one of opposite hinge points and whose radius is equal to a distance between centers of the first and second hinge pins. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a door hinge system for opening a hinged door, and more particularly to a door hinge system, which enables a hinged door to be opened in multiple directions, that is, to be opened either forward or backward at either lateral side of the door, and which has a simple construction, thereby enabling the door hinge system to be easily manufactured and the hinged door to be conveniently used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a conventional hinged door, which is provided at a wall of a building, furniture, or an electronic appliance such as a refrigerator, can be opened in only one direction of forward or backward at only one lateral side of the door. However, the hinged door openable at only one side as described above causes many limitations in the design of a building or the arrangement of furniture or electronic appliances. In other words, when a door-holding body, which means a wall of a building, furniture, an electronic appliance, etc., is designed or arranged, a sufficient space in which the hinged door can be pivoted must be secured, which imposes many restrictions on the design or arrangement of the door-holding body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Several doors and door hinge systems, which enable a door to be opened at either lateral side, left or right side, of the door, have been developed in order to overcome such a problem in the design or arrangement of the door-holding body as described above. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,836 issued to Kim, et al., entitled &ldquo;door hinge arrangement for opening the door at either side&rdquo;, discloses a door hinge system which enables a door to be opened at either lateral side of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, Kim, et al.&apos;s door hinge arrangement has a relatively complicated construction and a large number of elements including a holder, a receiving plate, various pins such as a stop pin and locking pin, a torsional spring, various grooves, etc., similar to other known doors or hinge arrangements for opening the door at either side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the conventional doors or door hinge systems known up until now, including Kim, et al.&apos;s door hinge arrangement, can enable a door to opened in only one direction of the door from either side, but there has been disclosed no technology capable of enabling a door to be opened either forward or backward at either lateral side of the door. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the field of toilet seats, and more particularly to a hinge for securing the toilet seat and cover which is adaptable to different seats and different toilets. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Currently toilet seats and seat covers are connected to two hinges which are each secured to the toilet bowl by a threaded bolt which extends through a hole provided in the bowl and is secured by a nut. The bolts may either be integral with the seat hinge or may be separate and extend through holes in the seat hinge. It is therefore difficult to replace or substitute a seat or cover with a different seat or cover since the entire hinge assembly must generally be replaced. Further, different manufacturers may use different spacing for the hinges and bolt holes, so seats are not interchangeable among manufacturers. A specialized toilet seat, such as the Combination Toilet Seat disclosed in the present inventor&apos;s U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,781 may be suitable for one manufacturer&apos;s toilet bowl but may not fit another&apos;s. There is therefore a need for a toilet seat hinge which allows different seats to be quickly replaced or substituted and which will adapt to different manufacturers&apos; bowls. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Throughout the following description, specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, the invention may be practiced without these particulars. In other instances, well known elements have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the hinge of the invention is generally designated as <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A toilet seat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is hingedly connected to hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by hinge lugs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are secured to the toilet seat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by screws or the like and which have cylindrical bores for receiving hinge pins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Toilet seat cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is hingedly connected to hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by hinge lugs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which are secured to the toilet seat cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by screws or the like and which have cylindrical bores for receiving hinge pins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which have cylindrical bores for receiving hinge pins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a base portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having tracks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> adjacent either end, as described in further detail below, and a central cylindrical block or body portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Attachment bolts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have nuts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and heads <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which slide in tracks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> attached to toilet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having toilet bowl <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, tank <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and bowl flange <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured through holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, shown in dotted outline, through bowl flange <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> second child&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown substituted for the seat cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> although a three-part Combination Toilet Seat having two nested seats and a cover, as disclosed in the present inventor&apos;s U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,781, may also be used. Hinge pins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extend through cylindrical passages in connectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, cylindrical passages in flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and into holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in body <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a variant of the hinge pin <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in which the length of the pin is reduced by reducing the length of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The second variant <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is useful where a two-part seat is used. Where a three-part seat such as the Combination Toilet Seat disclosed in the present inventor&apos;s U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,781 is used the longer cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as in hinge pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is required since the pin extends through an extra pair of lugs. The hinge pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is also described in the present inventor&apos;s U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,781 which is incorporated herein by reference. It is formed of a hard but resilient material such as plastic and has cylindrical body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a grasping flange <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extending from one end and elongated pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending from the other end. Pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a central slot <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> cut out along the central axis of pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which causes pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to have some diametric resiliency in a direction perpendicular to the length of the pin and the direction of the slot. A rounded camming protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided on pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to hold the pins in place in the manner described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 12</cross-reference> illustrate in further detail the hinge base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It has a lower surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which bears against the upper surface of toilet bowl <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and may have a cut-out <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to reduce the amount of material required for manufacture. Flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> have an outer rectangular aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and an inner cylindrical aperture <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Body <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has two cylindrical apertures <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> have a diameter slightly greater than the diameter of pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so they can receive the end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of hinge pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> have a diameter slightly less than the diameter of protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is prevented from extending beyond aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The height of aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is slightly greater than the diameter of protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> but the width is slightly less. This permits the portion of hinge pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to enter aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> freely when the protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is aligned with the longer dimension of the aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, but when rotated 90 degrees, the protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is cammed against the vertical sides of aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which compresses pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> due to the presence of slot <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, causing protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to bear against the vertical sides of aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with a friction fit. The apertures in hinge lugs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are preferably oblong in shape, with a longer dimension slightly greater than the diameter of protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a width greater than pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> but less than the width of aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, so that when the toilet seat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, hinge pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be inserted through connectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and when rotated, protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is cammed against the sides of aperture <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and prevented from being withdrawn through the apertures in connectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The apertures in connectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be cylindrical and have a diameter slightly greater than that of pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a central threaded passage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which threadedly engages threads <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> on bolt <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a head <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> with angled teeth <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to securely engage the underside of flange <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In operation, heads <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of bolts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are slid along tracks until the spacing appropriate to the spacing of holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in bowl flanges <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is determined. Bolts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are then extended through the holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and secured in place with nuts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The toilet seat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and toilet seat cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are then installed on the hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the toilet bowl <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on a hinge base <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> integral with the toilet bowl <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Preferably the base <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are built into the bowl itself by molding or casting. This removes the need for securing by bolts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and nuts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and similarly no tracks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, cut-out <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> or holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are present. The structure of flanges <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, body <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, with apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and hinge pins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are otherwise the same as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be construed in accordance with the substance defined by the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The disclosure relates generally to a hinge, and more particularly, to a multifunction hinge having weather-proofing qualities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are devices and especially container type devices that use hinges to facilitate the opening and closing of a door or lid of the device. The manufacturing cost for typical hinges is high and the amount of operable pieces required to manufacture such hinges is numerous, thereby increasing the chances of malfunction or failure of one of the components of the hinge. To construct a common hinge, the manufacturer may be required to obtain or manufacture four or more different parts. The manufacturer may then need to take the time necessary to assemble the various pieces. For example, the hinge may consist of a first hinge piece, a second hinge piece, a hinge rod and means to fasten the hinge pieces to the device. The assembly of the hinge would require the assembler to align the first and second hinge pieces, connect the first and second hinge pieces with the hinge rod, and fasten the hinges to the device using fastening means such as screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To improve the hinge, or to add additional features to the hinge, the manufacturer would have to add-on one or more pieces to the device or hinge. Other features may include weatherproofing or sealing the hinge, to avoid exposure of the device to the elements, or incorporating a door or lid regulator for regulating the opening and/or closing distance of the door or lid. In the past, weather-stripping made from rubber or the like has been added to the hinge to provide a better seal between the lid or door and the device. The weather-stripping, however, has a tendency to become unglued or become damaged. Even though the hinge may include weather-stripping, there usually remains a gap on either side of the hinge between the ends of the weather-stripping and the ends of the hinge, which allows for the elements, such as rain and snow for example, to penetrate into the device. Similarly, attempts have been made to regulate the opening and closing of the door or lid by disposing strings, cables or other restraining members between the hinge and the device. The restraining members, however, have a tendency to break, get in the way of the hinge, and/or become dislodged from the lid/door or device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, a multipurpose hinge assembly for rotatably connected a first object and a second object is disclosed. The first object includes a male portion and a mating surface having a ridge, and the male portion includes a fulcrum that is connected to the mating surface. The second object includes a female portion having a receptacle region, and a groove. The receptacle region receives the fulcrum, and the ridge engages the groove when the hinge assembly is in a closed position.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and with specific reference initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and may include a sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from relatively light weight, durable, and sturdy plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or other suitable plastic materials. Similarly, the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be injection molded, blow molded, continuously molded, extruded, vacuum formed, or the like. The manufacturing process or processes and materials can be selected based on feasibility, cost, tooling concerns, as well as other factors for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be the portion of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is part of, or is attached to, a body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of a structure (i.e. container, shed, box or the like), and the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be the portion of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is part of, or is attached to, an openable structure <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (i.e. door or lid). As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the male portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an integral part of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is an integral part of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In another example, the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be reversed and part of or attached to the openable structure <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of a structure, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can further be described as having an interior and an exterior. More specifically, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the interior of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located toward and facing the inside of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the exterior of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located toward and facing the outside of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an inside surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, an outside surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and may include the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed on and project from a mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may have a square, round, rectangular, triangular, or any other transverse cross sectional profile shape desirable. Further, the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be disposed along the entire length of the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and/or may be disposed on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such that the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engages with that portion of the lid or openable structure that rests upon the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. More specifically, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends along the entire top portion of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, in this example, abuts the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on one or both ends of the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and may, in combination with the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, form a contiguous wall along the entirety of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include a fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having a generally circular cylindrical surface and a pair of end surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The fulcrum is supported on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via a base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a center axis that is oriented such that the axis runs parallel to the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having on either end an end surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The end surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may be oriented substantially perpendicular to the center axis of the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and may be substantially similar in shape as the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> engages a receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is defined in the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be square, round, rectangular, triangular, or any other shape desirable, and in this exemplary embodiment has a substantially tetrahedral configuration. More specifically, the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located between the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and may be an integral part of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, but may also be constructed separately. The base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes the inside surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which extends from near an inside edge of the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and outside surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which extends from near an outside edge of the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be a contiguous piece, but may be one or more separate pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The interior surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes one or more interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that may be any suitable shape including round, oval, elliptical, or polygonal with three or more sides, and may be disposed between the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in this example, include a stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a plurality of guide surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends downwardly and inwardly from the upper part of the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, two guide surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> located to the either side of the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extend toward each other and inwardly from the sides of the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and abut the sides of the stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and a third guide surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> located near a bottom of the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends inwardly and upwardly from the sides of the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and abuts the bottom of the stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One or more exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are disposed on the outside surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in this example. The exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be similar or in shape and size to the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, or may be round, oval, elliptical, or polygonal. The cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are disposed between the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may be disposed on the outside surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in areas unoccupied by the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More specifically, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> located on the interior surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extend into the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> toward the exterior surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Depending on the depth of the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may extend through a majority of the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. If the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extend half-way through the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or more, then if the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are placed directly behind the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> will interfere with each other. By staggering or alternating the interior and exterior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> along the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may have a greater depth into the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> without interfering with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in this exemplary embodiment, is located on an underside of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and includes the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may be square, round, rectangular, triangular, or any other shape desirable, and is disposed on the underside of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and/or can be disposed on an area of the lid corresponding to or confronting the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the container when the lid is closed. The groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> terminates at the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on one or both ends of the female portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and may in combination with the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, form a contiguous groove along the underside of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In this example, the groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the lid is closed. The groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is complimentary to the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to permit the opening and closing of the lid and container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and/or ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can include a clearance or taper to avoid contact during hinged opening and closing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are located toward the inside of the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extend outwardly and downwardly from near an inside edge of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have a substantially inwardly curved shape and include sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may compliment and extend the inside surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the sliding surfaces of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may substantially abut the generally circular surface of the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such that the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> slide about around the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, during rotation of the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> about the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Similarly, located toward the outside of the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> near the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and extending outwardly and downwardly therefrom, are the one or more exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>. The exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be substantially similar to the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, having a substantially inwardly curved shape and including sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may compliment and extend the inside surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and more particularly, the inside surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, may create in combination with the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a complimentary shape to the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such that a combination of the inside surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> retains the fulcrum and allows rotation thereabout. More specifically, a combination of the inside surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may receive the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such that the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> snaps into the combination recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In another exemplary embodiment, the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of end surfaces <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. More particularly, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes side boundaries that define at least part of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Those side boundaries are created by the end surfaces <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are adapted to engage with the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, when the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in a closed position. More specifically, the number and location of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may correspond and be aligned to the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are adapted to engage with stop surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the exterior cavities, when the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in an open position, and more specifically, the number and location of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may correspond and be aligned to the interior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one example embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be utilized in combination with additional container hinges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and openable structures <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, such as lids. In this embodiment the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located on the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be separated into several sections, and may continue to create in combination with the male portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a contiguous wall. Similarly, the groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may also be separated into several sections, may extend over one or more openable structures <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and may continue to create in combination with the female portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> a contiguous recess. More specifically, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extends between the male portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby creating in combination with the male portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a contiguous wall. Similarly, the groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends from the female portions, and more particularly from the receptacle portions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, toward the edges of the respective lids <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Once the container is in the closed position (not shown), i.e. the lids <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are both in the lower position such that the bottom surface of the lids <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are adjacent the mating surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will connect and create a continues recess in combination with the receptacle portions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In operation, the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be attached to the solid structure, the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, or to the openable structure, the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and will herein be described as such. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the male and female portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are engaged by snapping the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the female portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Once snapped into place, the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is engaged with the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> or is engaged with a combination of the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such that the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> rotates within the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to open and close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Once the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the receptacle regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are engaged, several other components become aligned and engaged as well. For example, as the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are engaged thereby permitting rotational movement of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the end surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may engage, thereby restricting the axial movement of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. More specifically, as the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are snapped together, the length of the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be slightly shorter than the length of the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to restrict the axial movement of the fulcrum <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and hence the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Restricting the axial movement of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may also be accomplished by aligning and engaging the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and/or by aligning and engaging the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the width of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is slightly smaller than the width of the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are engaged, the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be restricted from moving in an axial direction. Similarly, the width of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slightly smaller than the width of the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. When the tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are engaged, the tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be restricted from moving in an axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be guided into the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via the guide surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> located in the cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. More specifically, as the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotate about the fulcrum during opening of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will rotate towards the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Before the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> abut the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be guided toward stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by the guide surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> which are angled toward the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotate about the fulcrum during closing of the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will rotate towards the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Before the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> abut the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be guided toward stop surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by the guide surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that are angled toward the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, as best illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the container hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a set of stops. A first stop can be optionally provided to prevent the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> from opening farther than desired, and a second stop can be optionally provided to prevent the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> from closing farther than desired. More specifically, the tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be manufactured in predetermined lengths, and/or the one or more cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be manufactured in different depths to effectuate and regulate the first and second stops. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, as the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is opened the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will move toward the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the exterior cavities <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. If the overall distance, between the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is reduced, by either increasing the length of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and/or by decreasing the depth of the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, or if the distance between the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is increased by either decreasing the length of the exterior tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and/or by increasing the depth of the bottoms <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the opening distance of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be regulated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is closed, the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will move toward the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the interior cavities <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If the distance, between the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is reduced, by either increasing the length of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or by decreasing the depth of the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or the overall distance between the ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is increased by either decreasing the length of the interior tabs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or by increasing the depth of the stop surfaces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the closing distance of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be regulated. However, in the disclosed example, the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will abut the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the closed position. Thus, this feature may not be needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and abuts the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on either side of the base <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The combination of the sealing ridge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the male portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> creates a contiguous wall on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is located on the underside of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and abuts the recess portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on both ends of the recess portion. The combination of the groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the receptacle region <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> creates a contiguous void on the underside of the lid <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. When the hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the closed position the contiguous wall engages with the contiguous void to create a seal such that elements such as water, dirt, particles, leaves or the like, are prevented from entering the interior of the container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While the present hinge has been described with reference to specific examples which are intended to be illustrative only and not to be limiting of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that changes, additions or deletions may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a triaxial hinge, and more particularly to a triaxial hinge for supporting a flat panel display on a desk or hanging a flat panel display on a wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal display (&ldquo;LCD&rdquo;) has been used widely, and a typical liquid crystal display can be rotated or tilted according to a user&apos;s need. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,493, entitled &ldquo;LCD Support System&rdquo; issued to Chen on Aug. 24, 1999 discloses a support structure for supporting an LCD. However, in this support structure, the LCD may just be rotated in one direction within a predetermined angle. Also, Taiwan Patent Publication No. 327460, entitled &ldquo;Liquid Crystal Display Device Capable Of Being Inclined Forward Or Backward&rdquo; published on Feb. 21, 1998, discloses an LCD capable of being inclined forward or backward in accordance with the required inclined angle. However, this LCD can be rotated only in one direction and cannot be rotated in other direction, so the need of a user may not be fully satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, Taiwan Patent Publication No. 465656, entitled &ldquo;Dual-axial Hinge For Liquid Crystal Display&rdquo; published on Nov. 11, 2001, discloses a dual-axial hinge for a liquid crystal display comprising a lower bracket, a lower bearing, a supporter, a connection bracket, an upper bearing, and an upper bracket. However, the structure of the connection bracket for connecting the lower bearing and the upper bearing is complex and occupies certain space. Also, the hinge has to be provided with the projection and the restriction mechanism to restrict the rotation angle, such that the cost of manufacturing is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,288, entitled &ldquo;Tilting hinge&rdquo; issued to Saito on Aug. 6, 2002, discloses a tilting hinge for frictionally pivotably vertically, horizontally, and swingably supporting a display device. However, the friction washer of the tilting hinge will be worn out or broken during the repeating rotation of the display device, so the rotation of the display device is not restricted within a desired angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Besides, the above-mentioned hinge apparatus of large dimensions occupies large space and thus cannot be widely adapted to various displays. These hinge apparatus can only support the LCD on a desk, but cannot be used to hang the LCD on a vertical wall, thereby limiting the uses of the hinge apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need for a multi-direction hinge which is simply structured and compact so as to be adapted to support varied displays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention relates to a triaxial hinge which is simply structured and compact, and is widely adapted to various flat panel displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention relates to a triaxial hinge of a display, and the triaxial hinge is provided with restriction elements of rotation angles formed inside the hinge so as to reduce the volume of the hinge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the present invention relates a triaxial hinge for supporting a flat panel display device on an external member. The triaxial hinge includes a first member, a second member, a third member and a supporting member. The first member is fixed to the external member. The second member is pivotally connected to the first member for defining a first pivot. The third member is pivotally connected to the second member for defining a second pivot perpendicular to the first pivot. The supporting base is pivotally connected to the third member for defining a third pivot perpendicular to the first and second pivots. The flat panel display device is attached to the supporting base and can be pivoted on the first, the second, and the third pivots, respectively, with respect to the first member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the triaxial hinge according to the present invention is simply structured, and the cost and the dimension of the triaxial hinge are reduced for being adapted to various displays. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, the triaxial hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is compact in volume. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the height H of the triaxial hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is about 42 mm. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the triaxial hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be adapted to support other type of flat panel display, such as plasma or light-emitting diode display. Besides, the triaxial hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be easily covered with a figurative housing element for providing the aesthetic and hidden function. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pivot pin assembly for pivotally mounting two highly loaded parts together, and which has an arm or lever that can be secured to one of the parts carrying the pin to prevent rotation of the pin as a second part, also mounted on the pin, rotates relative to the first part. In particular, the pivot pin assembly has a shoulder, forming a non-circular boss on one end and a retainer lever is provided with a bore fitting over the boss. A cap screw is screwed into the end of the pin and used to retain the lever on the boss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, pivot pins used in high load pivots, such as the pivot pin securing an accessory attachment plate to the front end of loader arms, are secured to prevent pin rotation when the two parts pivot. One form of pin retainer is to provide a cross bore through a support hub and the pin at one end, and inserting spring pin or a cotter pin to secure the pivot pin to the hub that surrounds the pivot pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In another type of pivot pin, a lever or plate is welded to the pin end and the lever is secured to a surface of one of the pivoting parts. This type of pin is widely used, but requires purchasing a heat treated pin, welding the lever or retainer plate on the pin, and then sending the weldment out for plating and/or further heat treatment after welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other types of securable pivot pins also are available, such as pins that have irregular shaped pin heads that will fit into a receptacle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pivot pin used to pivotally mount two parts together, such as a bucket or accessory mounting plate at the ends of loader arms. The pivot pin has a radially extending lever or retainer plate at one end of the pin that is secured to one of the parts to prevent the pin from rotating. The accessory mounting plate on a loader is tiltable on the pivot pins when underload, using a hydraulic cylinder. The pivot pins may tend to rotate unless restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The pins of the present invention are circular cross section cylinders having a central axis, which forms a pivot axis of the two parts that are held by the pin. An end of the pin has a surface that is at least partially at right angles to the central axis. A shoulder is formed at the one end so that the end surface is stepped or has a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;. The shoulder has a surface portion that is non-circular, to form a stop surface. A lever or plate has a bore or receptacle that receives the boss, and the lever bore has an inner edge surface that mates with the shoulder so the lever will not rotate about the pin axis. When the outer end of the lever is restrained by fixing it to one of the parts that is pivoted together, the lever will resist the torque that tends to rotate the pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The pin assembly of the present invention provides a great advantage in manufacturing. A hardened pin can have an end machined easily to the desired boss shape, and a lever opening can be punched to receive the boss at the end of the pin. The lever is held onto the pin end with a bolt and washer, or a flanged head bolt, that has a surface of size to bear on the lever to hold the lever onto the boss. The lever or arm is rigidly clamped to the pin when the bolt is tightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One form of the invention has a single flat surface so that the boss forms a &ldquo;D&rdquo; shape, and a second form has two machined, parallel flat surfaces forming the boss that extends diametrically across the end of the pin. The non-circular surfaces can be planar, serrated, undulating or other suitable configurations. The mating opening in the retainer lever or arm is formed to fit over the boss.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> pin assembly of the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is shown in place as a pivot pin joining a first part, which may be the end portion of a loader arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to a second part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that can be a hub from a bucket, or a quick attachment plate for a bucket or other loader attachment tool. The second part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will pivot relative to the first part loader arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, usually using a hydraulic actuator. Suitable bushings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be provided in the spaced apart end flanges or portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the loader arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and also a bushing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be provided around on the interior of the bore in the second part or hub <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The pin assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is restrained from rotation relative to one part, and in the illustrated embodiment the pin is held by attaching a lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to one of the end flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the loader arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The plate or lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to one end of the cylindrical pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This end of the pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as shown, has a boss <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed thereon, with planar surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along side the boss (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as shown, has an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that has a complimentary configuration to the periphery of the boss <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and fits over the boss. The lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rests against the surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are perpendicular to the central axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This central axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is the pivot axis between the first and second parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to retain the lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in position on the end of cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the pin assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the pin is provided with a threaded internal axial bore shown in dotted lines at <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and this bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends through the boss <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the interior of the cylindrical pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A flanged retainer, such as a washer shown in <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is positioned on the outer surface of the lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a cap screw <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is threaded into the interior bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to clamp the flange or washer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> against the outer surface of the lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and hold the pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a rigid assembly. The axial direction height of the boss <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is less than the thickness of the lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the flange or washer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is clamped tightly with the cap screw <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to securely hold the lever arm in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a hole or bore <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at an outer end thereof, spaced from the central axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a second cap screw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is threaded into a threaded opening in the flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the loader arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to secure the pin assembly in position and hold the unit tightly locked. The cylindrical pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not rotate and the pin assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will resist torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It can thus be seen that the pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be pre-hardened, before the boss is machined and before the lever arm is put into place. It can also be seen that the boss <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has straight, flat surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B on opposite sides of the boss in this form of the invention. Surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B are parallel to the central axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and are &ldquo;chordal&rdquo; surfaces offset from the central axis of the cylindrical pin portion. The surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B are perpendicular to the end surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and are noncircular surfaces that will provide a resistance to rotation of a lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a complimentary shaped opening or bore in position on the boss and secured in place with a cap screw. The lever arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be separately made, and the opening for the boss punched out. The pin and lever arm can be individually plated for corrosion protection. The hardened pin portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not have to be re-heated to restore its hardness after welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The final assembly can be made when the pin portion is put into place in the two mating parts, the lever arm can be put into place and the cap screw <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provided with a flange <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> tightened down to provide a force to clamp the arm or lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> against the end surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, with a different configuration for the boss and the lever arm. In this embodiment, a pin assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical pin portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and one end of the pin portion forms an end surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> perpendicular to a central axis <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the pin portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;D&rdquo; shaped boss <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed, with one chordal flat surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a rounded periphery <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is smaller diameter than the pin portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> surrounds the boss <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and provides a resting surface for the lever arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a complimentary opening <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to receive the boss <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A loading flange or washer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is placed over the outer surface of the arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and then a cap screw <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is threaded into place in an interior bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the pin portion to clamp the arm tightly against the surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The thickness or axial length of the &ldquo;D&rdquo; shaped boss <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> again is less than the thickness of the arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, so that the cap screw <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> tightly clamps the arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The pin portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can hardened, and then machined to form a boss having at least one noncircular shoulder surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as shown, is parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and forms a chordal surface that is non-circular, so when the complimentary shaped opening or bore in the lever arm or disc is placed over the boss, the lever arm will not rotate relative to the pin portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The shoulder surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> does not have to be planar or flat along its entire length. It is noncircular, however, to ensure that the arm does not rotate relative to the pin portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The lever arm or disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> again can be separately made, and then clamped in place either before or after mating the two pivoting parts together. The lever arms used can be shaped to accommodate existing structures, and provide adequate clearance for the lever arms. The lever arms can be shaped like discs, plates or other selected outer peripheries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this specification, the term lever arm or lever is intended to include discs, plates, straps and the like which are securable to one pivoting part at a position spaced outwardly from the axis of the pin to resist pin rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a pot holder and more particularly, to a pot holder which substantially prevents a user from being burned while remaining relatively pliable and soft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pot holders are commonly employed to permit a user to lift and hold heated cooking implements (e.g., pot handles, baking sheets, or lid knobs) without being burned. Conventional pot holders are generally comprised of a layer of insulating material (e.g., cotton batting) disposed between two layers of fabric which are sewn or otherwise coupled together to form a relatively thick insulated pad. These pot holders are also commonly &ldquo;quilted&rdquo; or sewn in a manner to form a plurality of rectangular internal chambers to prevent the insulating material from clumping or moving around within the outer layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Additionally, pot holders normally include a border or edge member which is attached around the outer periphery of the layers in order to retain the insulating material between the layers of fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While these current pot holders do prevent a user from coming into direct contact with heated cooking utensils, they do have several drawbacks. For example and without limitation, the quilted pattern only provides a nominal number of directions in which the creases or bend points formed by the internal chambers which permit the pot holder to relatively easily fold or bend about the cooking implement. These rectangular or rhomboid chambers undesirably only provide these creases bi-directionally (i.e., in the two directions of the sides of the internal chambers) and do not account for the various angles a user may attempt to utilize the pot holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, conventional pot holders have numerous visible lines of stitching across their surfaces (in order to form the internal chambers). These lines can undesirably reduce the aesthetic appeal of the potholder. This is particularly true if the exterior of the fabric depicts a certain design or picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the addition of a border around the exterior edge of quilted pot holders adds an amount of stiffness that increases the amount of force a user must exert in order to grasp and hold a utensil. This additional stiffness undesirably reduces the tactile sensitivity or &ldquo;feel&rdquo; perceptible to a user. This reduction in feel could be potentially dangerous when grasping a heated cooking implement (e.g., a pot containing boiling water). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Lastly, stitching or sewing the creases which form the internal chambers of conventional pot holders reduces the thickness of the potholder in the immediate area around the crease. This reduced thickness undesirably decreases the amount of or compresses the insulation which is beneath the sewn area. This results in areas of reduced thermal insulation that increase the chance of a user being burned through the pot holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is therefore a need for a new and improved pot holder which overcomes at least some of the previously delineated drawbacks of prior pot holders, which provides an effective and safe means to grasp heated cooking implements, and which can be used in a substantially omni-directional manner to grasp heated cooking implements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a first advantage of the present invention to provide a pot holder which obviates the need to provide an exterior border by disposing the stitching along the outer-most edge of the pot holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a second advantage of the present invention to provide a pot holder which reduces the amount of visible stitching along the outer edges of the pot holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a third advantage of the present invention to provide a pot holder which permits an individual to employ the pot holder in substantially any direction while reducing the amount of stitching along the visible surfaces of the pot holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a fourth advantage of the present invention to provide a pot holder which reduces the possibility of a user being burned through the pot holder. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is made in accordance with the teachings of the preferred embodiment of the invention. Particularly, the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a generally rectangular shaped piece of cloth, fabric, or other relatively soft and pliant material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g., cotton terry cloth) which is folded over itself along its center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form two layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> each having a substantially square shape and having sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are coupled together using conventional stitching <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along sides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in close proximity to the edges of sides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (e.g., approximately one-eighth of an inch (&frac18;&Prime;) away from the edges of sides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Stitching <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is further used to couple layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> along side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a manner substantially the same as sides <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, except a small gap or opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is left &ldquo;un-stitched&rdquo; along side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Stitching <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby creates a pocket <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having an opening or access point at gap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that gap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> disposed substantially in the middle of side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but this is for exemplary purposes only, as gap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be disposed any place along side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is inverted or &ldquo;turned inside-out&rdquo; whereby the interior surface of pocket <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> becomes the exterior surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inverted by forcing side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through gap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Importantly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, by inverting pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the stitching <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is disposed along the outer-most edge of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Inversion after stitching <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been applied to pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> obviates the necessity of using more complex sewing or coupling procedures to couple layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> together while substantially eliminating any superfluous and unaesthetic stitching on the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After inversion, gap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be stitched or sewn shut using a conventional cross-stitching technique, or any other procedure which precludes stitching being applied to top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of bend points or creases that run across the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. These bend points are formed by adding stitching lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after inversion. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are sewn in a manner where each of the lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> intersect each other at the approximate center point <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, each line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is equally spaced radially about a center point <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (i.e., each line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is disposed upon pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a certain angle <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which divides surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into substantially equal portions). Each line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> either starts in a corner of the potholder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) or at the mid-point of a side of the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). Each line is sewn across the entire surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and terminates at the opposite corner or side of the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By intersecting at center <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and traversing the entire surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of potholder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides a user with a bend point to fold over the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in substantially any direction, regardless of how the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is oriented when it is picked up by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes four lines of stitching <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and therefore angle <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> would be forty-five degrees and surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> would be divided into eight substantially equally sized portions. It should be noted that this number of lines of stitching and angle of separation are for exemplary purposes only and other numbers of lines of stitching are intended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, an additional layer or liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be provided to supplement the thermal-insulative properties of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Namely, liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is approximately the same size as pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is shaped to fit between layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is generally rectangular). Liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is inserted between the outer layers of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by first temporarily coupling it to the &ldquo;top&rdquo; surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (e.g., by using a few stitches to hold liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and inverting layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> along with the rest of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of thermally resistive material having a certain thickness <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of raised insulation surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which are coupled to layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and project from liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to have a thickness <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> that is larger than the thickness <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the raised surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are integrally formed with layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, but in alternate embodiments surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be coupled to layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Importantly, raised surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> traverse across the entire surface of liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a manner exactly like that of stitching <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Raised surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are oriented relative to each other so that each has a certain angle of separation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This angle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to angle <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the lines of stitching <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the number of raised surfaces which are upon liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may vary, but are always equal to the number of lines of stitching that traverse the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereby includes a plurality of raised surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which substantially align with the lines of stitching <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> previously described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, stitching <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> not only traverses across and through layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but also traverses across and through raised surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Stitching <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are similarly sewn across and through raised surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In this manner, liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a further layer of insulation in the areas of the pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that have lines of stitching coupling the outer layers together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the area between adjacent raised surfaces (e.g., the space between raised surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) also provides additional thermal insulation as these raised surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> form pockets or areas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of air between, for example the top layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This additional gap <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> separates the layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that requires any heat transfer to include not only conductive heat transfer but also radiant heat transfer thereby reducing the amount of heat which is transmitted from a heated surface on one side of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (e.g., surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) to the opposite side of pot holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (e.g., surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) where a user&apos;s hand may be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be made of substantially any heat resistant material which provides supplemental thermal protection while remaining relatively pliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact construction or method which has been previously delineated, but that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and the scope of the inventions as are set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims priority from German Patent Application No. 102 29 172.1, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a card top bar for a carding machine, having a carrying member and a releasable clothing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a known card top bar there are provided two end headpieces (card top heads), each of which slides on a slideway, the end head-pieces comprising at least one sliding region, which is in contact with the slideway, and at least one fixing region, which is in engagement with the card top bar and which at the same time holds the sliding region. In that known card top bar, the end head-pieces (card top heads) are associated with the carrying member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an aim of the invention to improve the known card top bar still further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a card top bar for a carding machine, having a carrying member and a releasable clothing portion, the clothing portion having clothing, a carrier for the clothing, and two card top heads, the card top heads comprising at least one sliding region arranged for sliding, in use, on a slideway, wherein the card top heads and the carrier for the clothing are in engagement with one another and form a structural unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The fact that the card top heads are in engagement with the carrier for the clothing makes it possible for the clothing portion, including the card top heads, to be manufactured as a separate component. In the process, it is made possible for a constant setting to be obtained for the important spacing between the sliding surface of the card top heads and the free ends (tips) of the clothing. Manufacturing tolerances in the carrying member, which is made, for example, from extruded aluminium, are substantially prevented from having an adverse effect on that spacing. A further advantage is that, when the clothing has become worn, the complete clothing portion (clothing strip, holding device and card top heads) can be removed and thrown away. It is especially advantageous that replacement of the clothing portion is carried out by simple means in the spinning room, it being possible for the carrying members to be re-used without modification. Precise setting of the card top heads relative to the clothing tips and, accordingly, of the important spacing between the clothing tips and the cylinder clothing (carding nip) is made possible by means of the measures according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The carrier may be of one-piece construction. The carrier may instead consist of a carrying element for the clothing and a compensating layer which may be connected to one another. The compensating layer may be arranged between the carrier and the carrying member. The card top heads may be in engagement, preferably non-releasably, with the carrier, for example with a compensating layer thereof, for example, directly or by way of an auxiliary carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The fixing region for the card top heads may be arranged in the compensating layer, for example with the sliding region extending outwardly beyond the carrier. Each card top head may have two elements, for example, pins of hardened steel or the like, the sliding surface of which may be ground, fine-ground and/or polished. The card top heads may be fixed in the respective end face of the carrier. Advantageously, the lower boundary of the card top heads is spaced from the free clothing tips. The carrying member and the clothing portion may form at least two composite components. The clothing portion advantageously comprises the carrier, the clothing and the card top heads. The carrying member and the clothing portion are advantageously connected to one another by releasable fixing means, for example, clips, clamps or the like. Fixing means, for example, resilient snap-fit elements, may be attached to the carrying member or to the clothing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The card top heads maybe connected to the carrier by adhesive action or the like. Advantageously, at least one continuous rod or the like, advantageously of a wear-resistant material, is provided, which extends over the width of the card top bar. The rod or the like may be accommodated within the carrier. The ends of the rod or the like may extend out beyond the carrier on both sides, in the form of card top heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Where a compensating layer is present, that may be of plastics material or the like, for example of a synthetic resin such as epoxy resin, or of polyester or the like. The plastics material, synthetic resin or the like may be curable, and/or may be pourable. It may be, for example, an adhesive. The plastics material, synthetic resin or the like advantageously adheres more strongly to the clothing carrier than at the bottom surface of the carrying member. The compensating layer may be a rigid foam. Advantageously, an adhesive layer may be provided between the compensating layer and the bottom surface of the card top bar. A compensating step may be provided in the bottom surface of the carrying member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The card top bar and the card top clothing are associated with the same reference plane. The reference plane may be a flat counterpart surface for the tip of the card top clothing, for example a plate or the like. The card top carrying member may be an extruded member of a light metal, for example aluminium, which is advantageously hollow and may be cut to length, for example by sawing. Advantageously, the cut-to-length carrying member can be straightened. Two end head-pieces (card top heads) may be associated with the carrier. Advantageously, a carrying element for the card top clothing, for example of textile material, and a compensating layer are arranged at a recess in the bottom surface of the carrying member. Advantageously, a spacing between the sliding surfaces at the card top heads on the outer surface of the slideway and the envelope curve of the card top clothing tips is even. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The card top heads may lie on a reference plane, for example a flat metal member or the like. The reference plane may be a magnetic plate. The plate and the reference plane may be attached to a common holding element. The reference plane and a further reference plane coinciding with the clothing tips may be orientated parallel to one another. The spacing between the reference planes may be adjustable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For manufacture, the clothing tips are set down on the further reference plane and the card top heads are set down on the reference plane, and an intermediate layer is applied between the carrying member and the clothing strip. The intermediate layer may be applied by melting, for example, after warming or otherwise heating. The underside of the carrying member may be structured, for example having recesses, protrusion, holes or the like. The carrier may have lateral recesses, grooves or the like for engagement of the fixing elements. Fixing elements may be present on the carrying members for engagement with the bottom surface of the carrier. The carrying member may have lateral shoulders, recesses or the like for engagement of fixing elements present on the carrier. For fixing the clothing portion, fixing means for example resilient snap-in elements may be attached to the carrier.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an arrangement suitable for manufacturing a card top bar according to the invention. Arranged in a fixed position on a flat plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, between the card top pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, is a parallelepipedal supporting element <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having parallel and flat surfaces and, between the card top pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a further parallelepipedal supporting element <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the same height h. Using this apparatus and further lateral fillet elements (not shown) or the like (for example, displaceable boundary surfaces for the compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and/or the carrying element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>), it is possible to position the clothing tips <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the clothing strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>on the supporting elements <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then introduced between the carrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the carrying element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. That may be accomplished by, for example, pouring it in, injecting it, spreading it in, laying it in or the like. The compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for example of paste-like consistency, becomes distributed in the intermediate space, filling it in compensating manner. In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is provided a static carrier element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>*, which can, for example, in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>be constructed in the form of a T-carrier or the like. The receiving portion for the card top pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may consist of, for example, a poured compound/adhesive, construction foam or the like. The height h always has the same dimension in the case of all card top bars, thereby eliminating dimensional tolerance. The fixing region of the card top pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is arranged in the compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the free end thereof&mdash;the region sliding on the slideway <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sliding bend <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>)&mdash;is located outside the compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, separate spring clips <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided, by means of which the structural unit composed of compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, clothing strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (consisting of clothing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and carrier <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and card top pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are not shown) is releasably fixed to the carrying member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the card top bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an embodiment wherein resilient clips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>are integrally formed on the carrying member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example during extrusion.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an embodiment, wherein resilient clips <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are integrally formed on the carrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, for example during extrusion. As a result, the clips <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are integrated into the carrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The clips have, on their free ends, engagement portions, which are in releasable engagement with corresponding engagement surfaces on the carrying member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The parts in engagement with one another may be bent over, for example at an acute or obtuse angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is enclosed by an approximately U-shaped tension bar <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> made from metal, above which the rear part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the card top bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed from rigid foam or the like. Provided at the top of the rear part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an approximately U-shaped compression bar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> made from metal. The compression bar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and tension bar <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> equalise forces and stabilise the rear part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The statically supporting part is also integrated into the wearing component. A sandwich construction makes that technically possible. This solution precludes the need for on-site assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The apparatus according to the invention substantially reduces the flatness tolerance and dimensional tolerance, measured over the clothing surface, within a card top set consisting of several card top bars <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A further important advantage is that, when clothings are replaced at the customer&apos;s premises, the installation work is reduced. As a result of the invention, the interface between pins (and clothing) is shifted. The pins are an integral part of the wearing portion, namely the clothing. As especially <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show, the clothing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, material <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, tolerance-compensating layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and card top pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>form one component. It is accordingly possible for dimension h always to be kept the same and for the customer to be provided with a component in which precision is already in-built. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show, by way of example, secure and simple mounting of this unit (component) on the static carrier.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a carding machine in which fibrous material is worked into a belt of untwisted fibres in the form of a web that will be condensed and passed on to subsequent processing stages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the carding operation is to turn raw material consisting of tufts of fibres, which have already undergone certain initial cleaning and opening processes, into a belt of untwisted fibres in the form of a web that is, as far as possible, free of impurities and non-homogeneities such as residual dirt from the previous processes, waste and tangles or &ldquo;neps&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As is known, in general terms, a carding machine comprises a main carding drum supplied by opening cylinders, generally termed &ldquo;briseur&rdquo;, while around it are a plurality of systems (a system of flats and auxiliary cleaning mechanisms and the like) which interact with the main drum in order to open, clean and attenuate the fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To improve the efficiency of the interaction between the systems surrounding it and the main drum and obtain a fibre belt that has ever less twist and is of increasingly high impurity, and hence of better quality, modern types of carding machines use a multiple feed to the main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One example of the above is disclosed, for example, in European Patent No. 927 779 in the name of the present Applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The multiple feed to the main drum provides ideal conditions for the systems interacting with the main drum to operate effectively on the fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, it has also been observed that the opportunity to make the best use of the thin layer of fibres presented to the main drum by the multiple-feed system, and so obtain a fibre belt with a high degree of parallelization and cleanliness, is inherently limited by problems with the reliability of the systems themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In other words, even though the systems interacting with the main drum are presented with a thin layer of fibre with good processing properties, nonetheless to achieve a high degree of parallelization and cleanliness of the fibre would still require the use of systems so advanced in their engineering properties as to make frequent maintenance necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is therefore a need to provide carding machines capable of improving the quality of the belt of fibres put out, while maintaining excellent characteristics of reliability and requiring little maintenance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a carding machine as a whole comprising a feed system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, auxiliary mechanisms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, systems of flats <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and doffer systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The feed system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of opening cylinders or &ldquo;briseur&rdquo;. The description which follows refers, by way of example, to a feed system provided with a first briseur <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second briseur <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each briseur has an external clothing around its lateral surface. This clothing is preferably of the saw-tooth type and these teeth project in the direction of rotation of the briseur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Upstream of the briseurs is a storage apparatus <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that comprises, for example, a first container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>upstream of the first briseur <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>upstream of the second briseur <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thus giving separate feed lines leading to the main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The constructional and functional details of the abovementioned feed lines to the main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are disclosed in European Patent No. 927 779 in the name of the present Applicant, the teaching of which is explicitly incorporated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment, there is, upstream of the briseurs, a single storage container supplying both simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The feed system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably also includes at least one fibre cleaning and attenuating system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> accompanying each briseur. The said system comprises, by way of example, clothed segments with flow deflector, blades and suction nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The briseurs are turned at a high angular velocity so that the clothing with which they are covered is able to pick up, by means of the teeth with which it is provided, the raw fibrous material supplied by the feed system and carry it around. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While on the briseurs, the fibrous material is preferably subjected to a first cleaning and attenuating action by means of the fibre cleaning and attenuating system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The briseurs interact with the main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by feeding the fibre to it at different points of its circumference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the carding machine, the points of interaction between the briseurs and the main drum are far enough apart around the circumference of the main drum to allow the insertion, in the peripheral region of said main drum lying between the points of interaction, of auxiliary pretreatment mechanisms comprising, in one embodiment, blades, clothed segments, suction nozzles and fixed sets of flats. On this subject, refer to document EP 1,207,223 in the name of the present Applicant, the teaching of which is explicitly incorporated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided around its lateral surface with a clothing having teeth that project preferably in the direction of rotation of the main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The main drum is turned at a lower angular velocity than the briseurs. However, because the said main drum has a much greater diameter than the briseurs, the peripheral speed of the said main drum is much greater than that of the briseurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the light of the above it will be realized that, although said main drum is rotating in the same direction, at the point of contact, as the briseurs and although it has clothing with teeth projecting in the direction of rotation, an at least partial transfer of the fibre occurs from the said briseurs to the main drum at the points of interaction between the briseurs and the main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> What happens is that the teeth of the clothing of the main drum move closer and closer to the teeth of the clothing of the briseur, collecting and carrying away much of the fibre from the briseur and carrying it around on the main drum in the form of a thinner layer of fibre than the layer of material that was fed to the briseurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While it is on the surface of the main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the thin layer of fibrous material undergoes the action of the auxiliary mechanisms <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and of the flat systems <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> surrounding the said drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary mechanisms preferably include blades, fixed clothed segments and suction nozzles. The said mechanisms work on the thin layer of fibre carried around by the main drum to effect a further opening of the fibre in addition to a further cleaning and attenuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the carding machine according to the invention, the flat systems include at least one fixed clothed segment, preferably a first fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a second fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and at least two sets of moving flats arranged downstream of the said briseurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The said flat systems preferably comprise a first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and, downstream of the said first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a preferred arrangement, the first fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is arranged downstream of the second briseur <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and upstream of the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, while the second fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is arranged downstream of the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the above arrangement, the first fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, preferably together with the suction nozzles and clothed segments of the auxiliary mechanisms, represents a precarding region situated upstream of the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, while the second fixed clothed segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, preferably together with additional suction nozzles or blades, represents a precarding region situated downstream of the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Between the first set of moving flats and the second set of moving flats there is preferably a refining region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which, in the embodiment described of the carding machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, advantageously has suction nozzles <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and at least one control plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The sets of moving flats possess a plurality of flats comprising a bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> whose length is equal to the length of the generatrix of the main drum and whose width is much less than the circumferential development of the entire set of moving flats. The said width of the bar preferably does not exceed a few centimetres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> That part of each bar which is towards the lateral surface of the main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a covering comprising a plurality of teeth pointing in the direction of travel of the said bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The structure, functions and efficiency of operation of this covering is characterized not only by numerous constructional parameters which define the geometry of the teeth, but also by the density of these teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In particular, the term &ldquo;population&rdquo; is often used in the industry to denote the density of the teeth of the bar covering, that is the number of teeth per unit surface area, for example per square inch or square centimetre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The first set of moving flats preferably has a population of teeth on its bars different from the population of teeth on the second set of moving flats. In particular, in a preferred embodiment, the population of teeth on the first set of moving flats is less than the population of teeth on the second set of moving flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In an illustrative embodiment of the carding machine according to the invention, the population of teeth on the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is between 200 and 500 points/in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(between 30 and 75 points/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), preferably equal to 400 points/in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(60 points/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), while the population of teeth on the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is between 400 and 1000 points/in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(between 60 and 160 points/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), preferably between 700 and 800 points/in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(between 100 and 130 points/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the constructional parameters of the teeth of the first set of moving flats give the said teeth a different working strength than the teeth of the second set of moving flats. The working strength of the teeth of the first set of moving flats is preferably less than that of the teeth of the second set of moving flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the carding machine, the work performed by the first set of moving flats is made less aggressive than the work performed by the second set of moving flats by appropriately adjusting the speed of travel of the flats, the radial registration between the main drum and the sets of moving flats, the carding angles of the said sets of flats, the angles of the teeth, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The carding machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> preferably also has registration means for registering the radial position of the sets of moving flats relative to the main drum. In an alternative embodiment, the said carding machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises first registration means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that act on the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and second registration means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that act on the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> With the machine in normal carding operation, the sets of moving flats set up a travelling motion of their bars which is substantially responsible for the effect of these sets of flats on the fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This travelling movement takes place at a slower speed of travel than the peripheral speed of the main drum and is either against or with the direction of rotation of the main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the direction of travel of the bars of the first set of moving flats is in the opposite direction to the travel of the bars of the second set of moving flats. As an example, the travelling movement of the first set of moving flats is in the opposite direction, in the area of interaction, to the rotation of the main drum, while the travel of the second set of moving flats is in the same direction, in the area of interaction, as the rotation of the said main drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As a preference, the speed of travel of the first set of moving flats is between 80 and 300 millimetres/minute, while the speed of travel of the second set of moving flats is between 100 and 500 millimetres/minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The bars of the set of moving flats are positioned around the main drum in such a way that they have a tolerance of positioning of the order of one tenth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> During normal operation of the carding machine, the thin layer of material supplied by the briseurs to the main drum is carried around by the main drum on the toothed clothing in which the said main drum is wrapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary mechanisms that surround the said main drum work the fibre on it, increasing its degree of cleanliness and attenuation, and complete its preparation for subsequent working by the sets of moving flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The interaction of the thin layer of fibre with the first set of moving flats works the fibre in such a way as to perform upon it, not only a cleaning action and an action of removal of neps or tangles, but also a first parallelization, by the action of the covering of the bars of this set of flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The teeth of the covering of the set of moving flats brush the teeth of the clothing of the main drum so that the fibre spread out on the main drum is straightened in a direction approximately tangential to the main drum, that is it is made parallel. In other words, the teeth of the covering of the bars brush the fibres and comb them out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the covering of the bars of the first set of moving flats has a tooth population less than that of the second set of moving flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The fibre now undergoes a first moderate parallelization whereby the fibres are straightened without damaging them, that is avoiding tears and breakages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The fibres leaving the first set of flats optionally undergo a further cleaning and attenuating action in the refining region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> between the first set of moving flats and the second set of moving flats, before interacting with-the second set of moving flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Here the fibre is subjected not only to another cleaning action and nep-removing action but also to a second parallelization, more thorough and efficient than the first, making good use of the preparation for this action given to it initially by the multiple opening of the briseurs and also by the first parallelization, always without producing tears and breakages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In other words, the multiple feeding of the main drum makes available a fibre that can be worked highly satisfactorily due to its characteristics of partial opening and cleanliness and to the fact that it is in a thin enough layer for a very thorough, aggressive carding action to be applied to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Owing to the partial straightening of the fibres in the first set of moving flats, the second set of moving flats can perform a very thorough parallelization without prejudice to the integrity of the fibre or to the general working conditions, as the fibre flows continuously and without severe straightening underneath the second set of flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> On leaving the region of interaction with the sets of moving flats, the fibre is conveyed to the doffer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be lifted off the main drum <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, optionally after having been further cleaned in the post-carding region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The doffer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises at least one doffer roller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The said doffer roller is again surface-covered with a clothing, preferably having sawteeth, by which it picks up the twistless fibres cleaned by the main drum, downstream of the systems of flats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The fibres are preferably taken from the doffer roller by a web-detaching unit and are condensed into a very thin web. The web then goes through a funnel which turns it into a slither. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In other alternative embodiments of the carding machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the refining region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> between the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided with at least one control plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which preferably forms a cover between the first set of moving flats and the second set of moving flats (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In other alternative embodiments, the refining region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> has a series of control plates <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, fixed clothed segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and suction nozzles with corresponding blade <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, variously combined with each other (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the provision of a refining region downstream of the first set of moving flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and upstream of the second set of moving flats <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> makes the work of the second set of moving flats more effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In particular, the refining region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is advantageously provided with control plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for working synthetic fibres in particular. The said refining region also has suction nozzles with associated blades and fixed clothed segments advantageously for working very closed materials or in relation to the degree of cleanliness of these materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In addition, other embodiments of the carding machine employ, between the points of interaction of the briseurs with the main drum, a combination of suction nozzles with corresponding blades, control plates, and fixed clothed segments. Advantageously, the said combinations make it possible to work the fibre supplied by an upstream briseur before the fibre is joined to the fibre fed in by a downstream briseur, in order, for example, to begin to even out the layer of two raw fibres which differ in terms of type, degree of cleanliness, opening and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The details of construction and function of these embodiments are disclosed in document EP 1,207,223 in the name of the present Applicant, the teaching of which is incorporated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the said carding machine comprises cleaning devices which cooperate with the said sets of moving flats in order to clean the said flats of snagged fibres, dirt and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Unusually, the carding machine according to the invention enhances the quality of the belt of fibre produced yet maintains excellent reliability and low maintenance requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the multiple fibre feed system presents a fibre that has excellent working characteristics capable of producing a sliver with a very high degree of parallelization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The system equipped with at least two sets of moving flats enables one of these to be used with an extremely high population of teeth but without the teeth acting aggressively on the fibre and introducing small lacerations in it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> At the same time, despite using a very high population of teeth, the synergy of the multiple opening and the multiple action of the sets of moving flats (which are preferably differentiated from each other) prevents any fierce braking action by the teeth on the fibres carried by the main drum. This is because the high population of teeth would produce a sort of &ldquo;dam effect&rdquo; on the fibres if the fibres were not already appropriately prepared for this thorough working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The fluidity with which the fibres opened by the briseurs are worked, first gently by a first set of moving flats and then more thoroughly by a second set of moving flats, gives the machine extremely low maintenance requirements and enables these systems to be run comfortably within their capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In another advantageous aspect, the carding machine further enhances the capacity of the second set of moving flats by enabling the fibre carried by the main drum to be put through further refining processes before it goes through the second parallelization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous aspect, the refining includes steps of cleaning and straightening which increase the fibre&apos;s readiness to undergo very thorough parallelization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Clearly, a person skilled in the art will be able to make numerous modifications and alterations to the carding machine described above in order to satisfy particular local requirements, all such modifications and alterations however lying within the scope of protection of the invention as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of boots and, in particular, to the field of sports boots. It relates to a brake device for a lace, of a boot, sliding in a base part linked to the boot, comprising a lever articulated on the base part, returned by an elastic means into a position of contact with the lace preventing the sliding of the lace in one direction by pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Gliding sports involve conflicting stresses that affect the structure of boots. On the one hand, boots have to have rigid elements to allow the user to guide the gliding device precisely and to feel the response of the device to its stresses. On the other hand, they have to have flexible elements to guarantee comfort by distributing the contact pressure around the user&apos;s feet as uniformly as possible. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Application EP 1 066 767, the content of which is incorporated by reference, discloses a boot having a rigid shell comprising a sole and on which a rigid collar is articulated. The shell has a notch on the top of the foot as far as the top of the instep. Semirigid elements are fixed on either side of this notch and overlap on the top of the foot to guarantee watertightness. These elements are produced, for example, from leather or from a synthetic material. This boot is closed and tightened using lever, tie, and buckle devices that interact with hooks. Such devices, when fixed on flexible elements, create zones of compression over users&apos; feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To remedy this problem, it is possible to use a lace, as in application WO 96/03186, the content of which is incorporated by reference. The snowboot described in that document has a hard shell produced in a single piece that surrounds the lower leg and heel of the rider, but has an opening on the top of the foot and soft parts covering this opening. The soft parts comprise eyelets in which a lace slides and, when tensioned, makes it possible to close and tighten the boot by the soft parts being brought closer together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, closure and tightening of a boot by a lace are impractical in the case of winter sports boots. Indeed, after having tensioned the lace, conventional use will be made of a knot in order to maintain this tension to guarantee closure of the boot. Such an operation may be particularly tedious when wearing winter sports gloves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Patent U.S. Pat. No. 1,242,774, the content of which is incorporated by reference, discloses a brake device for a lace that solves this problem. That document describes a device comprising a plate that has a hole enabling it to be linked rigidly to the upper of a boot, and that has a guide in which a lace is able to slide. At one of the ends of this guide, a fork-shaped lever is articulated about a pin orthogonal to the guide. This lever is returned into a position of contact with the end of the guide by a spring in order substantially to reduce the passage section for the lace at this end of the guide. In this way, when the lever is in contact with the end of the guide, the passage section for the lace is smaller than the cross section of the lace. Thus, when the lace is pulled in the direction that gives rise to the tightening of the boot, it slides freely in the guide, and when the lace is pulled in the opposite direction there is a pressing action by the lever and immobilization of the lace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This brake device has a major drawback. When it is desired to remove a boot that has such a lace-brake device, it is necessary continuously to act on the lever in order to allow the displacement of the lace, enabling the boot to be opened. This manipulation, which is normally inconvenient, is made difficult by the wearing of winter sports gloves. Moreover, when the boot is offered for sale, particularly in a department store, a customer who is unfamiliar with the boot and wishes to try it on risks being unable to slip it on his or her foot because the lace is too tight, and therefore moving on to another product. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to produce a lace-brake device that makes it possible to overcome this drawback. In particular, the invention proposes producing a brake device that allows the lace to slide in both directions after initial manipulation that can be carried out without difficulty when wearing winter sports gloves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The lace-brake device according to the invention is noteworthy in that the lever has holding means enabling it to maintain a second, stable position allowing the sliding of the lace in both directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The device preferably comprises a means for releasing the return of the lever into its position preventing the sliding of the lace in one direction when a defined tensile force is exerted in a defined direction on the free end of the lace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The means for triggering the return of the lever comprises a buckle articulated on the lever and inside which the lace slides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The holding means comprise a stud made on the base part or lever, respectively, interacting with a hole made on the lever or base part, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The holding means may also comprise at least one notch made in the base part, interacting with at least one notch made on the buckle, in which the lace passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the part of the lever for coming into contact with the lace has teeth that make it possible to increase the coefficient of friction between the lever and the lace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to variant embodiments of the device, the elastic means for returning the lever into its position of contact with the lace is a compression spring or a torsion spring mounted around the articulation pin of the lever on the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A boot-closure device of the type with a lever, tie and buckle type may be fixed on the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In this case, the closure device can be mounted slideably on the base part, and, when it is placed under tension, it may entrain the lever into its position preventing the sliding of the lace in one direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hooks for interacting with a closure device of the type with a lever, tie and buckle in order to close the boot may be present on the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the lever of a tightening device for opening the boot is manipulated, means can make it possible to bring the lever into its stable position allowing the sliding of the lace in both directions.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The ski boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a rigid shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> produced, for example, from injected polyurethane, a collar <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also produced from a rigid material and articulated on the shell in the ankle region. The boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> contains a comfort liner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises a sole, the front <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and rear <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> ends of which are shaped to allow the boot to be connected to a board for gliding (not shown) by means of bindings (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an opening located over the top of the foot and extending as far as the top of the instep. This opening is closed by two flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>produced from a flexible material and connected to the shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on either side of the opening. The flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>covers over the flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to make the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> watertight. The boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> further comprises semirigid elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also connected to the shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on either side of the opening. The flexible flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the semirigid elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected together by a joining piece <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> produced by means of an over-injection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The boot has closure and tightening means <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the lever, tie, and buckle type, interacting with hooks (shown diagrammatically). To supplement these tightening means, the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided on the top of the foot with a lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sliding in the loops <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the semirigid elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed to the front end of the boot on the shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the lace is tensioned by a tensile force being exerted on the free end of the lace, the two elements <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are brought closer together through the action of the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on them, and the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is tightened around the user&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The tightening device comprises a lever <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> connected by articulations firstly to a base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and secondly to a tie <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> integral with a buckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> interacting with hooks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the device has a brake device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, making it possible to maintain the tension in the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the boot has to be tightened around the user&apos;s foot, and allowing the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to slide in both directions when the user puts the boot on or takes it off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The brake device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</cross-reference> consists principally of a base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> produced in two parts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, of a lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> articulated on the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, of a guide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and of a buckle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> articulated on the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, located outside the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and traversed by the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The parts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which the lever <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is articulated (not shown in these figures) have through-holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>enabling them to be connected to the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by means of rivets. The lower part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the base part has a guide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sliding in the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At one of its ends, the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>allowing its articulation around a pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The other end of the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be manipulated by the user in order to change its position. A zone of the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has teeth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for coming into contact with the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lever also comprises a hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the buckle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is articulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A compression spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, housed in a bore <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made in the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, comes into contact with the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to return it into a stable, &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, in which the teeth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are in contact with the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lower part of the base part has an elastic tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, at the end of which a stud <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> interacts with a hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> made in the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order, by means of engagement of the stud <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to keep the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a stable, &ldquo;free&rdquo; position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, in which the teeth <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are not in contact with the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The moment created by the action of the spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lever is less than the moment that has to be applied to the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the stud <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to emerge from the bore <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the user wishes to slip his foot into the boot, he places the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the &ldquo;free&rdquo; position in which it is not in contact with the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The user can then insert his foot in the boot by relaxing the tension in the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Once his foot has been placed inside the boot, he pulls on the free end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lace in order to tension the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and to tighten the boot around his foot. This force on the free end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>brings the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into its &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position by means of the buckle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. From this moment onwards, the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can slide in the base part only in one direction, generating an increase in the tension in the strand <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the end of which is connected to the shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In fact, if a tension is exerted on the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a tendency to cause it to slide in the opposite direction, the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> exerts a force on the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that creates a moment about the pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that tends to apply the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> against the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Immobilization of the lace in this direction is produced by pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the user wishes to take his boot off, all he has to do is to manipulate the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to place it in its &ldquo;free&rdquo; position. He can then make the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> slide inside the base part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in either direction and consequently detension the strand <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to be able to remove his foot from the boot <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the brake device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> in the &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position, and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> in the &ldquo;free&rdquo; position. It differs from the device described previously in that it has a buckle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that makes it possible to place the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position, inside the base part composed of the parts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This buckle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is guided in a groove <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made in the base part. It has two studs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for interacting with two notches <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in order to keep the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in its &ldquo;free&rdquo; position. The passage from the &ldquo;free&rdquo; position to the &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position and vice versa is achieved by deformation of the parts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base part and of the buckle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A variant (not shown) of the embodiments of the device according to the invention has a torsion spring to replace the spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the devices described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The end of the free strand <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> advantageously has an element, such as a tab or ball, that makes it possible to facilitate its gripping and the application of a tensile force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a variant (not shown) of the brake device, the boot has means that make it possible, when the lever <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of one of the closure and tightening devices for opening the boot is manipulated, to place the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in its &ldquo;free&rdquo; position. These means are known in the state of the art and, in particular, from patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,794, the content of which is incorporated by reference. They may, for example, consist of a cable connected to one of the levers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the tightening devices, and acting on the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the brake device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The boot may further have means that make it possible, when the lever <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of one of the closure and tightening devices for closing the boot is manipulated, to place the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in its &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position. These means may, for example, comprise a closure device mounted slideably on the base part having the brake device. The displacement of the brake device during tightening of the boot is then used in order to place the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in its &ldquo;braked&rdquo; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Naturally, the invention may be applied to boots other than ski boots and may be applied, in particular, to snowboard boots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, a wide range of modification, change and substitution is contemplated in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances, some features of the present invention may be employed without a corresponding use of the other features. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to clips for hanging ductwork and piping and, more particularly, to a generally inverted T-shaped clip having an upright leg with a transverse slot formed adjacent to the upper end thereof, a first lower arm extending generally perpendicular to the upright leg adjacent to the lower end thereof, the first lower arm having a transverse slot formed therein, a second lower arm extending downward and outwards from the upright leg opposite the first lower arm and a third lower arm extending generally perpendicular to the upright leg on the same side as the second lower arm, each of the second and third lower arms including a transverse slot formed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A common method of construction of buildings involves the use of suspended ceilings to provide an appearance of a solid overhead structure which conceals the electrical, plumbing, and air-conditioning lines which run overhead. In fact, the majority of buildings constructed at the present time utilize one form or another of this type of construction method and therefore it is a vital element of this type of construction to properly suspend piping and ductwork from the ceiling to prevent the overhead lines from falling from their suspended location. At the present time, ductwork and piping are suspended from a ceiling structure by hanging a plurality of metal straps downwards from the ceiling structure, wrapping a section of the strapping around the piping or ductwork to be suspended, and attaching the end of the strapping to the depending strap section mounted to the ceiling structure thus suspending the piping therefrom. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show examples of the prior art, specifically two of the most common methods by which piping and ductwork are suspended from ceiling structures, and it should be noted that only very rarely in failure situations is it found that the point of connection of the strap to the ceiling structure is where the failure of suspension took place. Rather, due to the forces exerted on the screws which connect the strap section wrapped around the piping to the depending strap section, it is this point of connection which is often the failure location. There is therefore a need for a more secure device and system for suspending piping and ductwork from a ceiling structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another problem encountered in the prior art is that, due to the sheer number of straps which must be attached to the ceiling structure, it is common for the straps to be attached to the ceiling structure and left in place waiting for the piping or ductwork to be suspended to be attached thereto. However, if the strap is not of sufficient length to extend around the piping or ductwork, the strap must be removed and replaced with one of sufficient length. In the industry, it is quite common for this to occur due to the relative inexperience of some of the individuals working on a job site. This results in an increase in time expended in the erection of the building structure and, given a sufficient number of incidences, can result in costly penalties being paid by the contractor due to the extended length of time necessary to complete the project. There is therefore a need for a piping and ductwork hanging device and system which addresses and corrects this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an improved strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork which will quickly and safely mount piping or ductwork to a support strap depending from a ceiling allowing the piping or ductwork to be supported by the strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork which is generally inverted T-shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork which includes an upright leg with a transverse slot formed adjacent to the upper end thereof, a first lower arm extending generally perpendicular to the upright leg adjacent to the lower end thereof, the first lower arm having a transverse slot formed therein, a second lower arm extending downward and outwards from the upright leg opposite the first lower arm and a third lower arm extending generally perpendicular to the upright leg on the same side as the second lower arm, each of the second and third lower arms including a transverse slot formed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork which will generally eliminate the problem of mismeasurement of strap length commonly encountered during the suspending of piping and ductwork from ceiling structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Finally, an object of the present invention is to provide a strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork which is relatively simple and inexpensive to construct and is safe, simple and efficient in use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a strap clip for hanging piping and ductwork having a generally inverted T-shaped clip body. The generally inverted T-shaped clip body includes a generally upright leg having an upright leg transverse slot formed therein adjacent the upper end of the generally upright leg and a first lower arm extending generally perpendicular to the generally upright leg adjacent the lower end of the generally upright leg, the first lower arm having a first lower arm transverse slot formed therein extending generally parallel with the upright leg transverse slot. A second lower arm extends downward and outwards adjacent the lower end of the generally upright leg opposite the first lower arm, the second lower arm having a second lower arm transverse slot formed therein extending generally parallel with the upright leg transverse slot. A third lower arm extends generally perpendicular to the upright leg generally adjacent the second lower arm, the third lower arm having a third lower arm transverse slot formed therein extending generally parallel with the upright leg transverse slot. The strap for supporting the ductwork or piping would be extended through the various transverse slots in the manner described below in order to secure the strap clip on the strap and thus securely, safely and rapidly mount the ductwork or piping on the strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is thus seen that the present invention provides a substantial improvement over those inventions found in the prior art. For example, the design of the present invention permits the user to quickly and easily secure the ductwork or piping at the specified height on the support strap without requiring the numerous securement steps which are mandated by many of the devices found in the prior art, particularly the standard methods of securement described previously in this disclosure. Furthermore, as the present invention is relatively simple in design and manufacture, the cost for each unit is kept low which will enable the cost-effective use of the present invention, thus providing a safe and efficient improved alternative to presently available methods and devices for mounting and securing piping and ductwork on support straps. Finally, because the present invention does not rely on only a single point of securement of the strap to the piping or ductwork, there is far less chance of the piping or ductwork disengaging from the strap and plummeting downwards to cause damage to persons and possessions positioned beneath the suspended piping or ductwork. The present invention thus provides a substantial improvement over the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for supporting piping and ductwork is shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as having a generally inverted T-shape with an upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending generally vertically, the upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a height of approximately one to three inches and a width of approximately one to three inches. The upper portion of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent to form an angled flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the angled flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a height of approximately one quarter to one-half an inch and being angled from vertical between 10 degrees and 90 degrees in the preferred embodiment. Angled flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further includes an upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed extending therethrough, the upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a width of approximately one to two and three quarters inches and a height of approximately one-sixteenth of an inch to one-quarter of an inch ({fraction (1/16)}&Prime; to &frac14;&Prime;). The upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a supporting strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> therethrough, and the angle of angled flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows for frictional contact of the edges of first transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be placed on the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and be frictionally retained thereon prior to final installation of the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the straps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which are used in the industry are commonly formed of strip steel having a gauge of between 14 and 20 and a width of approximately one to one and a half inches (1&Prime; to 1&frac12;&Prime;), although the exact size of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is not critical to the present invention which is designed to function with straps of various dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Extending generally perpendicular to and outwards from the base of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which, in the preferred embodiment, would have a width approximately equal to the width of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a length of approximately one-half inch to one and a half inches (&frac12; to 1&frac12;&Prime;), and would extend generally perpendicular to or angled slightly downwards from perpendicular as related to the upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Formed in first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which extends generally parallel with upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and would have approximately the same dimensions as described in connection with upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is preferred, however, that first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> be formed at approximately the mid-point of first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such that first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is vertically offset from upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The vertical offset of upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enhances the frictional engagement of strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> such that the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be placed on strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending through upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is frictionally supported on strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This permits a user of the invention to place the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being used in the support of the piping or ductwork in the desired location prior to final installation so that the work crew following the clip installer to do the final installation knows precisely at what height to suspend the piping or ductwork. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Extending from the base of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction as first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which would have a length approximately one-eighth inch to one-half inch (&frac18;&Prime; to 1&frac12;&Prime;) longer than the length of first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a width approximately equal to the width of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the second lower arm would extend outwards and downwards from upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at an angle slightly greater than the angle formed between upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>. Second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> would also include a second lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having approximately the same dimensions as upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and positioned at approximately the mid-point of the length of second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Finally, a third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends outwards generally perpendicular to upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent to the base thereof on the same side of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> would have a length approximately equal to the length of first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a width approximately equal to the width of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is further preferred that third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> be connected to upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along a semi-flexible hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such that third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may move downwards slightly to engage second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and be generally parallel therewith upon force being applied to third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a downwards direction. Third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes a third lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having approximately the same dimensions as first and second lower transverse slots <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with the slot positioned at approximately the mid-point of the length of third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention be constructed of sheet metal cut into a single long strip and folded to form the various elements as described above, as understood by those skilled in the art of metal component manufacturing techniques. The resulting folded strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would then be spot-welded in several locations thereon to ensure that the clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will remain in its desired form. It is believed that this construction method will be the most efficient and cost-effective, although it should be noted that various other construction methods and materials may be used which accomplish the same result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to secure piping and ductwork in the following manner. A section of strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, extends downwards from a ceiling structure <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> prior to supporting a section of pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> thereon. The strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is placed on the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with the end of strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being threaded through upper transverse slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in angled flap of upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> downwards through first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be moved upwards or downwards on the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> until the proper location for the support of the pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is found. At this point, the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is bent sideways underneath first lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus forming a fold which supports the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the determined appropriate height. Alternatively, the clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be left on the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in frictional securement thereon due to the contact between strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the upper and first lower transverse slots <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should it be determined that the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> should not be bent at that time. The pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is then positioned underneath the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is extended around the pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The end of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is then extended upwards through second lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and upwards again through the third lower transverse slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is then pulled away from upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and simultaneously pulled downwards along the curved section of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> adjacent pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. This outwards and downwards pulling of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> pulls the strap tight around pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and in addition, immediately prior to reaching the desired point of securement, pulls third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> downwards into contact with second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, providing further frictional securement of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> between the second and third lower transverse slots <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> due to the offset position of those slots <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, due to the semi-flexible hinge connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to upright leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, release of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at this point returns third lower arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to its original position should adjustment of the positioning of pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> be necessary. Otherwise, the excess length of strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is removed and the strap end is secured either to the pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> or to the strap section adjacent pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, or the end of the strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be secured to any appropriate location. It is thus seen how quickly, efficiently and simply the pipe <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is mounted on strap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, particularly when compared with the laborious procedures mandated by the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate alternative embodiments of the strap clip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the present invention in which the first lower arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; and second lower arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&Prime; are bent at slightly different angles to accommodate pipe of various diameters. Likewise, the first and second lower arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&Prime; may be bent to be generally horizontal to accommodate ductwork or the like, yet still provide the same swift and simple installation of the piping or ductwork on the hanging strap. Finally, although it should be noted that the current state of the art for hanging rectangular ductwork requires the use of two strap hangers according to code, it is believed that the present invention provides a method and apparatus for hanging ductwork which is at least as safe as the dual strap method and which is far more efficient as was described above and therefore may be used for such applications in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that numerous modifications, additions, and substitutions may be made to the present invention which fall within the intended broad scope of the above description. For example, the precise materials and methods of manufacture of the present invention are not critical to the present invention so long as the functional characteristics of the invention are maintained along with the general structure of the invention. Also, the specific angles and position of elements used in the present invention are only critical to the extent that the functionality of the invention is maintained. Finally, it should be noted that, although the present invention has been described as including particular dimensions, modifications to those dimensions are contemplated and made a part of this disclosure so long as the invention functions according to the systems and methods described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> There has thus been shown and described a strap clip for supporting piping and ductwork which accomplishes at least all of its intended objectives. </paragraph>

The buckle comprises a lock lever, a manual release lever, a spring biased catch, and a latch positioned in a frame. A slide member is provided. The slide member operates to hold the latch in the locked position, and prevents a buckling member from being released from the buckle when the buckle is in a locked position. In the open position, a spring moves the slide and the buckling member out of the frame, thereby releasing the buckling member from the buckle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a buckle, more particularly, the present invention relates to a buckle with a buckle release system that can be used with a parachute harness. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A harness for use with a parachute may include a buckle having a buckle release system for releasing the harness from the canopy of the parachute. A conventional buckle, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,247 to Warrick et al., has a buckle release system for the manual or automatic release of a crewmember harness from its associate harness. This conventional buckle has a frame that receives a cooperating buckling member (tang) that is secured to a portion of the harness. A tang assembly secures the buckling member in the frame. A latch that pivots between a closed position and an open position holds the tang assembly. The latch is intended to prevent the inadvertent release of the buckling member from the frame. A lever that includes a cavity holds a free end of the latch. During operation, the lever is moved to an open position in order to release the latch. However, like other conventional buckles, the buckle disclosed in the patent to Warrick et al. may not open and release the harness under some difficult and extreme conditions. Failure of the buckle to open and release can be hazardous to the wearer of the harness. For example, the canopy may exert a substantial force on the harness when the conditions are windy. If the buckle fails to release or the wearer is unable to operate the buckle, the aircraft personnel could be dragged along the ground or through water due to the force of the wind on the canopy. This could place the wearer in great danger of receiving significant bodily injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists for a buckle with a buckle release system that can withstand and operate under difficult operating environments. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention includes a buckle with a buckle release system for releasing a parachute harness from about a wearer. The buckle release system can include a manual release mechanism and/or an automatic release mechanism. In one embodiment, the buckle release system comprises a lock lever, a manual release lever, a latch, and a spring-biased catch. The lock lever can hold the manual release lever in the locked position and provide a guard to prevent inadvertent/accidental release of the buckle. When the lock lever is removed from engagement with the manual release lever, the manual release lever is operable and capable of moving relative to the frame of the buckle. The manual release lever is capable of engaging with and rotating a shaft having a catch disposed thereon. The catch is engageable by the manual release lever but can be independent of the manual release lever such that when the catch is rotated through operation of an automatic release mechanism, the manual release lever does not rotate with the shaft and catch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the catch has a pivoting end, a free end, and defines a latch recess with a latch holding ledge disposed thereon. In this embodiment, the latch holding ledge is capable of engaging with the free end of a latch that is pivotally attached to the frame. The catch can be biased in the locked position, for example, by a spring. The latch can comprise a tooth capable of rotating into and out of engagement with a slide. The slide moves in reciprocal fashion in the frame between locked and open positions, and has a first end and a second end opposite the first end. In an embodiment, the slide can comprise a tooth contacting shoulder that cooperates with the tooth on the latch to hold the slide in the locked position. In this embodiment, the slide comprises a slide contacting shoulder that may be at about a 45&deg; angle and shaped to engage with a buckle lip on a buckling member that is attached to the harness. The frame comprises a narrow portion that defines a &ldquo;necked down&rdquo; opening that enables the buckling member to disengage from the slide in an open, position, and provides an obstruction to keep the buckling member engaged with the slide when the slide is in the locked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The buckle according to an aspect of the present invention includes a buckle release system that can be operated by aircraft personnel under difficult and potentially life threatening conditions. Additionally, the buckle can be resistant to sand for situations where the parachutist lands on a beach or other sandy environment. As a result, the buckle according to an aspect of the present invention can operate under conditions that would otherwise pose a dangerous situation to the wearer.</paragraph>

In an embodiment, the buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be permanently mounted into the cockpit of an aircraft (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, can comprise at least one angled surface having an angle of about 45&deg; relative to a planar member with which it forms a contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> contacts a slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of a slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> positioned within the buckle frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. As a result, when the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is securely retained within the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will be secured within the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can include multiple angled surfaces having an angle of about a 45&deg; relative to the planar member with which it forms the shoulder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that cooperates with the shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> while the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is held in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> by the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The 45&deg; angle of the buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> causes the cooperating buckle member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to wedge between the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> at a wedge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. This wedging creates a friction fit proportional to the pulling force exerted on the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. This friction force in turn causes the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to lock into the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The wedge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also limits the force exerted on a latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> within the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as discussed below. As a result, when the buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released, the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> moves to the left, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and in a manner to be described, in order to release the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> from within the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the buckle includes a lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is pivotally mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prevents the accidental release of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> keeps the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the locked position to prevent the release of the buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is movable between a first, locked position <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and second, unlocked position (not shown). In the first position, the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> engages and locks the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in place. In the second position, the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moved clockwise to a location where it is free of engagement with the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is out of the way, the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be manually operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises a catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In an illustrated embodiment, the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is biased by a spring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is capable of engaging with the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disposed thereon. The catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is engageable by the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> but is independent from the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such that when the shaft or pivot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is rotated through operation of an automatic release mechanism <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not rotate with the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This situation allows for the automatic operation to buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with the lock lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in either the closed position or locked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can comprise a pivoting end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> connected to the pivot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a free end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> defines a latch recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located adjacent to a latch holding ledge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the closed position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is located in the latch recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> defined in the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The latch holding ledge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of engaging with the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spring biased clockwise by the spring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with respect to the orientation of the pivot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The pivot end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is attached to the latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> rotatably supports the latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spring-biased in the locked or closed position when it is configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises a tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> capable of rotating into and out of engagement with a slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located between the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the latch shaft or latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> also comprises a projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that extends from the pivot end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is on the side of the latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> opposite the tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> One of the functions of the projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is to prevent the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> from moving too far to the right, as will be described presently. A slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> provides the force required to move the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> out of the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition to being held in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may also be reciprocated within the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> back and forth as indicated by the arrows designated A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This reciprocation of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is between the locked position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and the open position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> comprises a first end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> opposite the first end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The above-described projection contact <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is attached to the second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> further comprises a tooth contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> near the second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the tooth contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> cooperates with the tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to hold the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the locked position. The slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> further comprises a slide wall <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and a slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> near the first end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is shaped to engage with the buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> comprises a narrow portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and defines a &ldquo;necked down&rdquo; opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The narrow portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extends into the necked down opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The narrow portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> enables the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to disengage from the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in an open position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and provides an obstruction to hold the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> engaged with the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> when the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is in the locked position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is positioned between the second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and an internal wall <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is for forcing the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to the left, when viewed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is released from the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> forces the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> out of the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, thus moving the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> out of the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> through the frame opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Operation of the Buckle Release Mechanism </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In operation, the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the closed position when it is in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the closed position, the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spring biased in the clockwise direction, as shown in the figures, by the spring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is biased between the second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the internal wall <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Also, the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is held in the buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as discussed above. This can be accomplished by, for example, the shoulder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> contacting the slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> forming the wedge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and because the tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> blocks the movement of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to the left when viewed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> only supports a portion of the load exerted on the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> because of the wedge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which, along with the projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, assists in preventing relative movement between the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. As a result, the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> cannot move left or right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The buckle release system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thus in the locked position, because the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> cannot be pulled out of the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Rotating the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> clockwise with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> unlocks the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Rotating the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> counterclockwise with respect to the orientation of the figures and against the force of the spring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, causes the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate counterclockwise about the pivot <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As a result, the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> moves out of the latch recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> defined in the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and away from the latch holding ledge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> rotates freely in the clockwise direction under the force provided by the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> moving to the left under the force of the slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which may comprise one or more torsion springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Additionally, during the rotation of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> moves along slide wall <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Once the tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> clears the slide wall <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is freed, and moves to the left, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, under the force of the slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The tooth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> then slides over the tooth contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) as the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> continues moving to the left. Also, the projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise about the latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and it engages with and contacts the back <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and to a lesser degree assists slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in moving the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to the left. The latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can continue to rotate clockwise until the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> contacts the latch stop portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is proximate the necked down portion or narrowing portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that accommodates the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> when the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in the locked position. In one embodiment, the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is held in the locked position by, at least, the combination of the narrowing portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that is locked in place by the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> cannot slide over one another, because they are both located in the narrowing portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. This causes the 45&deg; angle wedge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that locks the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with a friction force caused by the upward force exerted against the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the downward force exerted by the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> But, when the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise, the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> moves to the left (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is allowed to move to the left. The opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> allows the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to move therein as the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> continues to move to the left. At substantially the same time, the buckle lip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> slides over the slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Continued movement of the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to the left results in the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> being removed from the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> no longer obstructs the removal of the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> from the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Additionally, an embodiment of the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to be readily reinserted into the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and secured in the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by the buckling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is inserted into the opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the end of the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the contact between the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> causes the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to rotate counterclockwise about latch pivot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Also, the slide spring <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> compresses. In response, the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is then rotated counterclockwise. As a result of the motion of the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise against the force of its spring until the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> moves into the latch recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> engages latch holding ledge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by pushing the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> into the frame <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from left to right with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the latch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is automatically rotated counterclockwise back into its starting position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, wherein its free end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> engages with the latch recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> defined in the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> rotates to it starting position, contacts the second end <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the slide, and prevents the slide <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> from moving to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reset as described above, the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed into engagement with the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to prevent inadvertent counterclockwise rotation of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is held in its closed position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) by springs (not shown) that bias the lock lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the counterclockwise direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plan view of the buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an electronic assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that provides for automatically releasing the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. If certain conditions are met, such as the sensing of water in the event the parachutist jumps/lands in a body of water, the electronic assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> automatically causes a ram <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be fired into the catch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> causing it to rotate counterclockwise with respect to the figures. This automatically causes a portion of the buckling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to rotate to an open position and release the buckling member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> from the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The automatic release mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,368, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a buckle system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> including a buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be opened manually or automatically, as discussed below. The buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes housing frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> that has a first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> secured to a portion of a known, man-mounted flight harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As with the above discussed buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be secured to the webbing of the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in any known manner, for example, by wrapping and securing a portion of the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> around a post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is securely retained at the second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> securely receives a cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> secured to the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be secured to the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in any known manner including wrapping and securing a portion of the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> about a post <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> secured to a frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is securely received within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, as discussed below, the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will be locked relative to the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> comprises a narrow portion <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> and defines a &ldquo;necked down&rdquo; opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The narrow portion <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> extends into the necked down opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The narrow portion <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> provides an obstruction to hold the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> engaged with a moveable slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> when the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned substantially completely within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in the locked position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes the moveable slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that reciprocates within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrows B. The slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a first end <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> opposite the first end <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The first end <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> includes a toothed portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that cooperates with a toothed mating portion <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to hold the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> when the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in its locked position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>). The slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> further comprises a slide wall <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and a slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> near the second end <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> is shaped to engage with a latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as discussed below when the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted into the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the mating portion <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a profile that complements the profile of toothed portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment, the toothed mating portion <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of converging, angled surfaces <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> that extend at an angle of about 45&deg; relative to a planar portion <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> that intersects the angled surfaces <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> at respective shoulders. Similarly, the toothed portion of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes converging, angled surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which may also comprise an angle of about a 45&deg; relative to a planar surface <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> that intersects these angled surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at respective shoulders. When the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is positioned within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the angled surfaces <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> contact the angled surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and their associated shoulders <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> while the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in its locked position within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The angled surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> can extend at other angles relative to their respective planar surfaces. As with buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, these angles can be between about 25&deg; and 75&deg;. In particular embodiments, the angles can be either 30&deg; or 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In operation, the angle cooperating angled surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> cause the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to wedge between the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This wedging creates a friction and interference fit that is greater than the pulling force exerted on the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during its use. This friction and interference force in turn causes the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to lock into the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a buckling system that comprises a manual release mechanism <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and/or an automatic release mechanism <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The manual release mechanism <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is capable of moving toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during the release phase and toward the opposite end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during the locking phase. The movement of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is substantially arcuate rotation about its pivot axis <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also includes a cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> that is secured to the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> so that the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> will rotate relative to the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> can rotate upwardly in a counter-clockwise direction and downwardly in a clockwise direction with respect to the side of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> shown in the figures. However, it is understood, that the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> rotates upwardly in a clockwise direction when viewed from the side of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> opposite that illustrated in the figures. The cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes a forward lip <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is proximate the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> when the cover is in the closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The forward lip <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> operates as a block to prevent the premature and inadvertent manual release of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by contacting the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and preventing the rotation of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when in the closed position, the lip <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> contacts the release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and prevents it from moving within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and causing the buckle to prematurely release. The lip <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> does not prevent the automatic release of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> caused by the activation of the automatic release activation system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also includes a catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that can be secured to the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> by a frangible connector. A spring <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> biases the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> into its locked position as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, the frangible connector includes a shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> that extends between the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> extends through an opening in both manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> contributes to coincidental movement of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> when the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is operated. However, the shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can fail and thereby permit the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to move freely relative to the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> when the lip <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> prevents the rotation of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> as discussed below. In this instance, the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> does not rotate with the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as the buckle releases the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Other known frangible connectors can be used in place of the shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a pair of opposing pivot side ends <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Each of these pivot ends <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> rotates about an axis <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> as the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rotates from its locked position to its open position; The catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> proximate its lower surface <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> receives a portion of a latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> when the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is in its locked position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> also includes a back surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> that extends between a pair of teeth <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> positioned on opposite sides of the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The back surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> can receive a ram plunger <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> from an automatic release mechanism <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as discussed below and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is rotatable about its axis <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a grooved portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> at a first, free end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> that extends in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The grooved portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is received in the recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as discussed above. The latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also includes a tooth <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that is capable of rotating into and out of engagement with a portion of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to prevent the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from moving relative to the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The tooth <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is located at a pivoting end <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that is opposite the grooved portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The pivoting end <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> rotates about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be reciprocally moved within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in the directions of the arrow B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reciprocates between the locked position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and the open position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, bias the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are positioned between a support member <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, which is spaced from the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the second end <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As a result, when the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> rotates during the releasing phase of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is released from the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> force the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> have a spring constant that provides sufficient force to drive the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the toothed portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> out of the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, thereby exposing the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. During the locking phase of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted in the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is forced against the bias of the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in the direction of the second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Operation of the Buckle Release Mechanism </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> operates in a similar manner to the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in its locked (closed) position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is spring biased toward the second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Also, the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is held in the buckle frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> by the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as discussed above. Specifically, the toothed portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the narrow portion <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> create a wedge-like interference fit with the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The toothed portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the narrow portion of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> contact the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as it moves within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and prevents the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from inadvertently and unintentionally exiting the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is prevented from rotating or otherwise moving in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> by the lips <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. When the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is in its closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> cannot be manually released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Rotating cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> causes the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to be exposed. Then, the manual release member <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be rotated in the clockwise direction with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> rotates, the shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> causes the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to rotate in the same direction as the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As a result, the first end of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> moves out of the latch recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> defined in the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and away from a latch holding ledge <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> then rotates freely in the counter-clockwise direction under the force provided by the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> acting on the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and moving the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> toward the first end of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Additionally, during the rotation of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the tooth <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> moves along the slide wall <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Once the tooth <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> clears the slide wall <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, the slide <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is freed, and moves toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> under the force of the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The tooth <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> then slides over the tooth contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> continues moving toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Also, the projection <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> rotates counter-clockwise with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> about the latch pivot <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The projection <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can engage with and contact the second end <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and to a lesser degree assists slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in moving the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> toward and through the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can continue to rotate until the free end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> contacts a latch stop ledge <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is rotated in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> allows the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to move within and out of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> moves toward and through the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. As the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is exposed outside the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and thus the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be separated from the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the harness <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> removed from the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Conversely, as discussed above, when the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in the locked position, the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is held in place by the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is locked in place. The slide contacting shoulder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> cannot slide over one another, because they are both located in the narrow portion <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This causes the illustrated interference wedge that holds the cooperating buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> within the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. However, to achieve the locked position, the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> must be inserted into the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Insertion of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and locking of the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is accomplished by forcing the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> against the force of the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The engagement between the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and their insertion into the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> causes the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to move toward the second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This movement of the slider <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> causes the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to rotate in the direction of the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> about latch pivot <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. As this occurs, the slide springs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> continue to compress. The clockwise rotation of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> causes the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to rotate toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> continues to rotate toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and against the force of its spring until the free end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> moves into the latch recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the free end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages the latch stop ledge <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as discussed above with respect to the buckle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the introduction of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and movement of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> toward the second end <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> causes the latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to rotate into its starting position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, wherein its free end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> engages with the latch recess <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> defined in the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The projection <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> rotates to it starting position, contacts the second end <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and prevents the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from moving toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Once the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in the locked position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is closed and placed into engagement with the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to prevent inadvertent movement of the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is held in its closed position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) by springs <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As discussed previously with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the buckle according to the present invention can includes an automatic buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). This automatic buckle release mechanism <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can include an electronic assembly <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that provides for automatically releasing the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If certain conditions are met, such as the sensing of water in the event the parachutist jumps/lands in a body of water, the electronic assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> automatically causes the ram <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to be fired into the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to rotate toward the first end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Since the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is prevented from moving relative to the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> by the cover <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, the shear pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> fails in response to the contacting of the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by the ram <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. As a result, the catch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rotates relative to the manual release lever <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This causes the slide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to move in the direction of the opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the automatic release of the buckling member <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the buckle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. One such automatic release mechanism <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> usable in the buckle according to the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,368 that is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener comprising a box, a box pin and an insert pin, which are provided at ends of a pair of fastener stringers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are various configurations of separable bottom end stops for a slide fastener, each separable bottom end stop being molded integrally with ends of fastener stringers using thermoplastic synthetic resin. However, a common feature in structures of the separable bottom end stops is that the box pin and the insert pin are integrally molded with one end of opposing edges of the pair of fastener stringers at least so as to be fixed thereto. In addition, usually the box is molded in a shape of a thin rectangular box, and a cross-section taken parallel to a short arm direction of the box, the short arm having a partition wall in a center of an inner side thereof, presents substantially a shape of the letter &ldquo;H&rdquo; turned sideways. Further, side portions of a long-arm side of the box have slit-shaped openings respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Right and left spaces of the box which are defined by the partition wall, include a box pin insertion hole and an insert pin insertion hole into which the box pin and the insert pin are inserted respectively from one end of the box. Because, as mentioned above, the box pin and the insert pin are respectively fixed to the opposing edges of the pair of fastener stringers, the fastener tape portion of the each fastener stringer is also inserted into the slit-shaped opening when the box pin or the insert pin is inserted into the respective insertion hole of the box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In recent years, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 8-98707, 10-14617 and 2000-106917, protruding guide portions which extend substantially parallel with respect to the insert pin and the box pin are molded integrally with the inner face of the fastener tape side of the insert pin and the box pin, via thin guide portions. The thin guide portions and the protruding guide portions allow the insertion operation of the insert pin and the box pin into the respective insertion holes in the box to be carried out easily. In addition, with ensuring secure and smooth insertion of the insert pin and the box pin, the thin guide portions and the protruding guide portions have a function for stabilizing the separable bottom end stop and the attaching portion for said bottom end stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that in order to ensure flexibility of the thin guide portions between the protruding guide portions, and the box pin and the insert pin, nylon which is very flexible, is often used as a material for forming the separable bottom end stop. However, increased demand for matching with diversification of fashion in recent years and various colors spreads even to a field of slide fasteners and other types of fasteners. In addition, a rapid action to the demand has been required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, conventionally, nylon is not used so much as the material for forming the slide fastener except for the separable bottom end stop, and there is a limit to the amount used. Additionally, it is difficult for nylon to meet the demand for matching with various colors, and further, nylon has high hygroscopic property, so managing the material is difficult. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention was developed with the foregoing present situation in view, and a specific object of the invention is to provide a separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener having an excellent durability with a material used for various purposes in the relevant field and being colored easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the inventors set out to select a material that would replace nylon as a thermoplastic synthetic resin material of the separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener. As disclosed in the publications listed above, polyacetal resins are used much in slide fasteners as well as in other types of fasteners. Polyacetal resin is hard and easily handled, and is easy to manage because it has low water absorptivity and the quality of it does not alter with time. In addition, molding can be carried out easily and various colors can be realized when using polyacetal resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the polyacetal resin is hard and stiff, but it is also brittle. As a result, the box pin, the insert pin and the protruding guide portions individually tend to break easily and further, adhesive strength with other material is low and stripping tends to occur easily. Generally, before the separable bottom end stop is molded integrally with a fastener tape, a reinforcing film or a tape made from other flexible material is adhered to a region of the fastener tape where the separable bottom end stop is molded. Therefore, in the case where polyacetal resin is used to form the separable bottom end stop, the separable bottom end stop itself can be stripped from the fastener tape easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To solve the problem of easy stripping, if a large number of holes are formed in the region of the fastener tape where the separable bottom end stop is molded, the resin of the material passes through the holes and connects front and rear surfaces of the fastener tape upon molding. As a result, jointing strength is increased so that stripping can be prevented. At the same time, breakage of the box pin and the insert pin can be avoided. However, especially when the box pin is inserted into the insert hole in the box and fixed thereto, or when the insert pin is inserted into the insert hole in the box or removed therefrom, the box pin or the insert pin is often bent with respect to the box around the thin guide portion between the protruding guide portion and the box pin or the insert pin. If degree of the bending is large, the thin guide portion will break easily. If the thin guide portion break, the configuration of the separable bottom end stop cannot be kept stable and the separating operation also becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the past problems are solved and at the same time, inconveniences resulting from use of polyacetal resin material are eliminated. The basic structure of the invention is a separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener comprising a box, a box pin, and an insert pin, in which protruding guide portions which protrude onto respective fastener tapes are integrally molded with side faces at the tape-side of the box pin and the insert pin, via thin guide portions, wherein the separable bottom end stop is formed of a polyacetal resin, and a distance d between each of outer side faces of the box and each of the protruding guide portions when the box pin and the insert pin are mounted into the box, and a protrusion height h of each of the protruding guide portions from a surface of each of the thin guide portions satisfy the following equation (I): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d/h</italic></highlight>)&gE;33&deg;&emsp;&emsp;(I) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> where d&ne;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If the value of tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(d/h) is less than 33&deg;, there will be a large degree of bending around the thin guide portion between the protruding guide portion and the box pin or the insert pin, and thus the thin guide portion will break easily. If the value of tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(d/h) exceeds 33&deg;, the protruding guide portion will abut the side face of the box and there will be no further bending thus preventing breakage. Meanwhile, it is to be noted that, assuming that the distance d between each of the outer side surfaces of the box and each of the protruding guide portions is 0, that is, assuming that width dimension of the thin guide portion is made 0, it becomes difficult to insert the box pin and the insert pin into the insertion holes of the box and thus difficulty of the operation is increased. It is to be noted that in a conventional type separable bottom end stop made of nylon, the value of tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(d/h) is 12&deg; and the value is extremely small.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A typical embodiment of a separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener according to the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Usually, in the separable bottom end stop for the slide fastener made of thermoplastic synthetic resin material, a box pin and an insert pin is integrally molded with one end portion of a pair of fastener stringers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by injection molding at first and then, a box is molded independently. The box and the box pin have an engagement portion by which they are engaged and fixed each other when the box pin is inserted into the box pin insertion holes of the box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a partial plan view of the slide fastener of the invention in which a part of the separable bottom end stop is cut. It shows an engagement state in which the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inserted into the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and integrated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In order to mold the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with end portions of the right and left fastener stringers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a thermoplastic resin film or thin cloth tape is first adhered to an end portion of a fastener tape <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, or thermoplastic synthetic resin is permeated through the end portion of the fastener tape to thereby form a reinforcement portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is generally molded by injection molding on both front and rear surfaces of an attachment side for fastener elements of the reinforcement portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, only polyacetal resin is used as the material for forming the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Each of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a pin portion having a cross section in which trapezoids are overlapped each other at the bottom sides thereof. The box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are molded such that each of which has substantially the same height of coil-like fastener elements <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, one side of which is substantially aligned with outer side of inverse portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the coil shaped fastener elements <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the other outer side edge of which is substantially align with the side edge of the fastener tape <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also, thin guide portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed from each inner side face of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the fastener tape side so as to have a distance d within which thin flanges of a slider (not shown) can slide freely. In addition, protruding guide portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising small plates, which are thinner than the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which protrude from front and rear surfaces of the fastener <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, are molded at the side faces of the thin guide portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to be parallel with the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively. The protruding guide portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have a height less than that of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and have a height higher than that of the thin guide portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the dimension h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An upper surface of a first half of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a plurality of small projections <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed to project therefrom. After the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inserted into the box pin insertion hole in box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, these small projections <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are melted with the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by ultrasonic wave heating, and the box pin and the box are joined together so as to be integral. Front end portions of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are slightly bent in a respective inner direction and they guide the outer face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and also the outer face of a flange (not shown) of the slider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exterior of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a substantially square thin box and slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through which the thin guide portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> respectively are inserted, are formed in both side walls of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, a partition wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in a center of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to define the box pin insertion hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the insert pin insertion hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at the left and right sides thereof. It is to be noted that several rows of small projecting portions are formed at a top portion of the box pin insertion hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the box and the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be joined together. In this case, even when small projections <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are not formed on the upper surface of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, joining of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be carried out by ultrasonic wave heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The separable bottom stop is operated as follows. First the slider (not shown) is slid and attached to the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is fixed to one of the fastener stringers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Next the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is mounted on the other fastener stringer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inserted from a shoulder of the slider. After the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been inserted up to the insert pin insertion hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the slider is pulled upward in the closing direction and the slide fastener is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For separating and opening the slide fastener, the slider (not shown) is slid and attached to the to the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and then, the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled out from the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the slider, thereby the slide fastener can be separated into the right and left fastener stringers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The most characteristic feature of the invention is that the material used for forming the separable bottom end stop for the slide fastener, in which the protruding guide portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which protrude onto respective fastener tapes are integrally molded with respective side faces at the tape-side of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the thin guide portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is polyacetal resin; and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the distance d between each of the outer side faces of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) when the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is mounted into the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a protrusion height h of the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) from the surface of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) satisfy the relationship tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(d/h) &gE;33&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This relative equation was derived as a result of repeated experimentation in an effort to physically eliminate the tendency for breakage with using polyacetal resin which is formed from ordinary material without any special change of the material, based on the fact that polyacetal resin allows various colors, reduces the changes in the quality of the material, has sufficient rigidity and is easy to be operated, but has a characteristic defect to break easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically shows the bent state of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), as well as the relationship at that time, between the distance d from the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the projection height h from a surface of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) to a surface of the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). At this time, the extent of curvature when the thin guide portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is curved in the direction of the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has its limit when an inner linear ridge portion of the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) which is exposed at the outer portion is abutting upon the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Even in a state where there is no bending, the dimension in the tape-width direction of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is such that even when the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is bent, the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is not long enough to bend onto the surface side of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustratively shows the limit for bending of the separable bottom end stop of the invention, which is formed of polyacetal resin. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is for comparison to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and illustratively shows the limit for bending of the separable bottom end stop of the prior art, which is formed of nylon. In these drawings, it is clear that because the polyacetal resin is used for the separable bottom end stop of the invention, a value of tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(d/h) which is the bending limit, that is, an angle &thgr; formed by the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the surface of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) when the inner ridge portion of the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) abuts on the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is 33&deg;. However, if the angle &thgr; has a normal value of 12&deg; or lower, which is extremely low when compared to 33&deg;, breakage does not occur in the conventional separable bottom end stop made of nylon, because the nylon is flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the invention, setting the value &thgr; at 33&deg; or more allows unexpected effects to be achieved. That is, by satisfying the equation above, when the dimensions of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) are the same as that of the device of the prior art, it is possible for the width dimensions of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in the tape-width direction to be smaller. As a result, the total dimension of the separable bottom end stop in the tape width direction can be made smaller. With the width dimension of the separable bottom end stop of the prior art, when the slide fastener is sewed to an attachment object, the machine needle touches a portion of the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and there is a problem that breakage tends to occur at this portion. However, because the entire dimension in the tape-width direction of the separable bottom end stop is smaller, the machine needle no longer touches any portion of the protruding guide portions, and thus breakage is no longer a concern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> However, the width dimension d between the outer side face of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the surface of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) must be greater than 0. If that value of the dimension d is zero or less, when the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted and fixed to the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or when the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into the insert pin insertion hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the width dimension of the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in the tape-width direction becomes too small, and thus the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) cannot be inserted through the slit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is formed on the side portion of the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or it may become impossible for the insertion of the box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the box <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be carried out smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Other improvements are also achieved by this embodiment of the invention. For example, measures were taken to prevent the tendency for stripping from its occurring, which is caused by the lack of adhesive power of polyacetal resin. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference symbol <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>denotes each of a plurality of small holes formed in a molding portion of the separable bottom end stop in the conventional fastener tape <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the separable bottom end stop is being molded, the molten resin is penetrated through from the front to the rear of the fastener tape <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the small holes and these small holes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>bridge the insert pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (box pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the protruding guide portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and the thin guide portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) which are molded to the molding portion of the separable bottom end stop in the tape <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and ensure strength with respect to stripping. In order to further increase the strength with respect to stripping, as is shown by the broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in addition to the small holes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>more small holes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are also formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As described above, the invention makes it possible to provide a separable bottom end stop for a slide fastener, which eliminates tendency for breakage to occur and has excellent durability, while having other excellent physical properties; despite using polyacetal resin which is a material that tends to break, to form the separable bottom end stop. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A self propelled lawnmower protective component used to support the grass catcher door is formed of a plastic material that is more flexible than the polyethylene material used in the prior art. By using co-extrusion, two different plastics are extruded into one shape. When applied to the lawnmower structure, the adhesion between the basic profile and a co-extruded ball or flap is extremely tight. Metallocene olefin is the plastic material which, when compressed under load and heat, recovers its original shape, similar to a soft rubber product and still has the capability of adhering to the polyethylene profile, so as not to separate after continuous or repeated use. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is an improved construction of plastic parts used in manually propelled lawnmowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As disclosed in the aforementioned co-pending applications, every effort is made to protect the operator of a manual pushed walk around grass cutter by constantly scrutinizing the device for opportunities to improve on the safety factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Those applications focused on an area in need of improvement involving grass cutters that can be used with or without grass bag attachments. Those grass cutters usually have a spring-loaded door permanently attached as part of the cutter body itself When the cutter is used without a grass bag attached, the door is spring loaded closed, however, when a grass bag is used, its installation process requires that the spring-loaded door be hand held open. The entire bag and assembly is attached to the mower and the spring-loaded door is released. The door then rests on the surface of the plastic trim that surrounds the entire opening of the grass bag itself The problem is that air escaping between the plastic trim on the bag, and the door surface (referred as blow back) is sufficient enough to cause concern for the operator&apos;s safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The solutions disclosed in the my aforementioned co-pending applications involve the use of certain materials and making certain structural changes in profile so as to reconfigure the plastic trim that contacts the door surface, including the introduction of a small hollow ball as part of the plastic profile or use of a flap to seal the door. The plastic material used in the co-pending applications solved the problems caused by the pressure from the spring-loaded door compressing part of the ball or the flap as the case may be producing a good intimate contact between the spring-loaded door and the material of choice. As is known in the art, after hours of use, as the grass cutter tends to heat up, the hollow ball on the one hand or the flap on the other hand assumes a permanent set, so that when the grass bag is removed, the ball or the flap becomes permanently distorted from the pressure from the spring loaded door and the elevated temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The second plastic material for the hollow ball or the flap has many obstacles to overcome: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 1. The adhesion between the two materials has to be intense enough to prevent separation between the two materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 2. The hollow ball or the flap should be flexible enough to compress on contact with the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The plastic material manufactured by Advanced Elastomer Systems, Akron, Ohio solved all of the above named problems. These products are commonly referred to as TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer) one of which is sold under the trademark SANTOPRENE. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention forms the flap or ball from a second plastic material that is more flexible than the polyethylene material used in the prior art and is less expensive than the TPE used in the co-pending applications. The process for forming the device is commonly referred to as co-extrusion. Two different plastics are extruded into one shape. When applied to the lawnmower structures, the adhesion between the basic profile and the co-extruded flap or ball must be extremely tight since any breakage or separation of the flap or ball from the remainder of the structure will create a severe safety problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> I have found a plastic material which, when compressed under load and heat, recovers its original shape, similar to a soft rubber product and still has the capability of adhering to the basic polyethylene profile, so as not to separate after continuous or repeated use and still return to its original shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Polymerization of olefin monomers with single-site metallocene catalysts allows the production of polyolefins (such as polyethylene or polypropylene) with a highly defined structure and superior properties. Furthermore, the structure of these metallocene catalysts can be varied to &lsquo;tune&rsquo; the properties of the polymer. Thus, for the first time it is possible to tailor carefully the properties of large-volume commodity polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> These plastic materials, known as metallocene olefins, are manufactured by a number of suppliers solved all of the above named problems. Through the co-extrusion process, I have extruded a flap and ball of one material (metallocene olefin) onto a supporting clip of a second material (low density polyethylene). The final products have been tested and have solved the blow back problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The foregoing, as well as further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description of my invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Metallocene refers to the type of catalyst used to produce the polymer, i.e. metallocene catalyst. Metallocene and other single site catalysts are used for polyolefins. Metallocene catalysts are metallorganic compounds that can work as activators for the reaction that produces the polymer. A metallocene type catalyst gives a polymer with a narrower molecular weight distribution and a more even comonomer distribution. This results in a polymer with an improved profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the flap type lawnmower component of the prior art modified in accordance with this invention. A flap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to a spring clip formed between spring hook <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and elongated member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The flap is joined to the spring clip at portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The spring clip is formed of low-density polyethylene. The flap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed of metallocene olefin. The flap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed onto the spring clip at portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by co-extrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side view of a ball type lawnmower component of the prior art fabricated in accordance with my invention. A hollow ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed of metallocene olefin. The ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed onto the spring clip (formed by hook <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and elongated member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), at portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by co-extrusion. The spring clip portions elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed of low-density polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> rear discharge lawnmower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a grass catcher bag <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> attached thereto. One or more of the components of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or is supported either vertically or horizontally in seams <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed on the front of the bag <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The elongated portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the component is mounted in the seams <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that the flap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can hold open the lawnmower&apos;s spring loaded rear trap door (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of my invention. In this embodiment, an additional volume of metallocene olefin is deposited in area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> adjacent portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This additional volume of material is required to provide additional strength to absorb the forces imposed on the device because of the way the assembly is attached to the lawnmower. The area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may contain a volume of material sufficient to occupy approximately 20%-40% of the cross-sectional area of the ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to provide the required strength. The ball <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is co-extruded onto the portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The additional volume of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by co-extrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The following example shows the process by which the invention was made. Co-extrusion of different plastic materials is described in the prior art, namely, my U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,591, issued Jan. 26, 1999 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Using the co-extrusion methods and apparatus disclosed in my patent, the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was fabricated using metallocene olefin and LPDE (low-density polyethylene).

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for laterally expanding a traveling web having longitudinal slits, which can be used in making non-woven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional method for producing non-woven fabric laminations comprises the steps of: preparing longitudinally elongated, split films <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> each having a lot of long or short slits longitudinally made therein; laterally expanding the split webs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>; and laying them crosswise on each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to provide a non-woven fabric lamination. Otherwise, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), longitudinally split-and-laterally expanded films <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and laterally split-and-laterally expanded films <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are alternately laid on each other to provide a non-woven fabric lamination. Non-woven fabric laminations thus provided are strong, light, stable in size, and air-permeable, and can be used as reinforcement materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A conventional net-like web expander comprises a curved application rod, a rubber roll, a screw roll having spiral grooves made on its circumference or a cloth guider which grip the opposite longitudinal edges of the net-like web to pull it wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another conventional expander is called &ldquo;Cage Roll&rdquo;, which is shown for example, in Japan Patent Application, Publication No. S-46-43,275. It comprises a pair of disks facing each other, somewhat inclined toward each other, and a plurality of coiled springs parallel-arranged at regular intervals on the circumferences of the opposite disks, and fixed thereto. The &ldquo;cage roll&rdquo; thus made is so placed relative to a net-like web to be expanded from side to side that the opposite disks are inclined toward each other symmetrically with respect to the center line of the net-like web, which is being fed from the upstream side of the expander. While the &ldquo;cage roll&rdquo; rotates, the coiled springs are sequentially put in contact with the traveling web in synchronism with the traveling speed of the web, thereby making the web to be forcedly expanded from side to side. Specifically the web is laid on the coiled springs of sequentially increasing length, and hence sequentially increasing spiral pitch (ring-to-ring distance), thereby sequentially stretching the series of wavy-contact portions of the web toward the required width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The conventional expanders, however, cannot laterally expand web fibers evenly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of this one object of the present invention is to provide a web expander which can laterally expand and distribute web fibers evenly across the required width. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To attain this object a web expander according to the present invention comprises a web expander comprising means for carrying a web having longitudinal slits, means for expanding the width of the web, and opening control means for uniformly forming size and form of openings of the web expanded by said means for expanding to form an expanded net-like web. Preferably the opening control means is a ribbed roll having raised lines formed on its circumference, which ribbed roll is rotated in the direction in which the raised lines function to decrease the width of the net-like web, which is kept in contact with the ribbed roll. The ribbed roll may be curved, and may be rotated while maintaining a direction of the curved condition. The ribbed roll may be straight, and may be rotated. Two or more ribbed rolls may be used. The means for expanding the width of a traveling web may include a cloth guider having two rolls so as to grasp one longitudinal edge portion of the net-like web. The means for expanding the width of a traveling web may include at least one member selected from the group consisting of a flat expander keeping in contact with one side of the net-like web for expansion, said flat expander having a plurality of parallel rubber strings laterally stretched, a cage roll having a plurality of coiled springs expandable laterally in the direction in which the net-like web is expanded, a bow rubber roll, a bow rod applicator and a screw roll having a screw groove made on its cylindrical surface. The means for expanding the width of a traveling web may include a controller for controlling the width of the net-like web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as may be understood from the above, the web expander is useful in expanding the traveling web having longitudinal slits with its openings opening wide in same size and form, providing the expanded net-like web having its fibers distributed even. Use of such expanded net-like web significantly improves the quality of non-woven fabric.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERERED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A web expander according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention is described below by referring to accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an outline of the web expander <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It comprises a web feeding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for feeding a pre-expansion web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the upstream side of stream (traveling) of web to be expanded, an annealing oven <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an expander unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for expanding the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of carrying means such as web feeding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an opening control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for opening the slits of the expanded web into openings of same size and form, and a post-treatment means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. All of these units and means are arranged in the order named in the upper-to-down stream direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The web feeding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a feeder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is shown only an axis in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> bearing a web roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a pair of pinch rolls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to unroll and draw the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the web roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, two guide rolls <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> positioned between the two guide rolls <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pulled out by the pinch rolls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the stretch applied to the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled to be a fixed strength by the tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and by the guide rolls <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is traveling from one to the other guide roll <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The annealing oven <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a duct equipped with a fan and a heater (not shown). The web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaving the feeder is exposed to the blow of hot air to remove its distortion before reaching the expander unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thus, the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made free of strains and unevennesses completely, which would cause adverse effect on the web when expanded. The annealing oven <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, however, may be omitted, depending on the kind, characteristics and expansion rates of the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaves the guide roll <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the annealing oven <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is subjected to expansion in the expander unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> where the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is expanded somewhat wider than required. For the purpose the expander unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and two cloth guiders <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> placed on the downstream side of the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises two rotatable disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> facing each other, and a plurality of parallel rubber strings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged at regular intervals on the circumferences of the opposite disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and fastened thereto to form a cylindrical cage. Two opposite stationary stands <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have adjustable screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to abut on the opposite disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The opposite disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be inclined by driving selected adjustable screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that they may be inclined symmetrically. When the opposite disks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thus symmetrically inclined toward each other rotate in synchronism with the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the rubber strings are sequentially put in contact with the traveling web in synchronism with the traveling speed of the web, thereby the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be forcedly expanded from side to side. For example, assuming that some adjustable screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are tightened on the side of the web inlet, and that some other adjustable screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are loosened on the side of the web outlet, the rubber strings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are allowed to shorten at Point &ldquo;A&rdquo; and to extend at Point B. The traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is put in contact with the roll at Point C, and it is being continuously expanded before reaching Point D. The expansion is caused by the friction between the rubber strings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show a roll type of cloth guider as viewed in the web feeding direction and in the crosswise direction, which is perpendicular to the web feeding direction. The cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises two rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to grasp the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> therebetween. These rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are rotatable. Their center lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are laid in one and same plane, and the rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> diverges somewhat toward the center line of the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, forming a small divergent angle &thgr; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In this particular embodiment two pairs of cloth guiders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are arranged in series in the direction in which the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> travels, and two cloth guiders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each pair are arranged crosswise of the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are arranged one or the other longitudinal half of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At least one of the two rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in each cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic material such as rubber. These rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> pinch one longitudinal half of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, diverging at a given angle &thgr; so that their diverging ends may be separate to delimit the gap equal to two or more times as wide as the thickness of the web, and equal to 30 or less times as wide as the thickness of the web. Thus, the pulling force applied to the web to pull it laterally outward decreases toward the center of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If these rolls were closely applied to grasp either longitudinal half of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, leaving no gap therebetween, the pinched longitudinal half of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could not be expanded, and the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would be split longitudinally along the boundary between the opposite pinched halves of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> because an increased splitting power is applied to the boundary. These two problems can be solved by inclining the rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in divergent form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> One roll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is at a fixed position to the roll support member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The other roll <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is fixed to an opening-and-closing means, which comprises a pneumatic diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and an arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is movable to the direction of thickness of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the roll <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can move close to and apart from the counter roll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has another arm <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> connecting the arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the roll support member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from turning about the pneumatic diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement the roll <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is limited to the movement in a plane in which the center axes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are contained. The opening-and-closing means can put the roll <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in contact with the traveling web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without allowing the arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from turning about the pneumatic diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is equipped with a pneumatic sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for detecting one longitudinal edge of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pneumatic sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises upper and lower pneumatic pipes leaving therebetween a small gap still permitting invasion of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The lower pipe has a small hole <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for ejecting an air stream toward the upper pipe, which draws the air stream. When the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> pulls the longitudinal edge of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the air port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the air stream is interrupted, and interruption of the air stream is detected to send a signal to a control (not shown). The control is responsive to the signal representing interruption of the air stream for controlling the opening-and-closing of the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when the longitudinal edge of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches the air port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, an associated pneumatic valve (not shown) is actuated to put the pneumatic diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in operation, thereby momentarily releasing the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to allow the longitudinal edge of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to leave apart from the air port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> decreases in width. And immediately the longitudinal edge of the web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is caught again by the upper and lower rolls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to be pinched therebetween. This is repeated to expand the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a fixed width as required. A contact type or photo-electric type of sensor may be used in place of the pneumatic sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The opening control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises one ribbed-roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> put in contact with one side of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and another ribbed-roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> put in contact with the other side (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the ribbed roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates how the ribbed roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is applied to one side of the netlike web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (fibers not shown). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ribbed roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a plurality of oblique grooves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> made on its circumference, and it is curved and applied to the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The oblique grooves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are inclined symmetric relative to the center of the roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thus forming spiral rib-like ridges <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), which are inclined to be symmetric with respect to the center of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The curved ridged-roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is forcedly rotated while maintaining a direction of the curved condition by an exterior drive (not shown) in the direction in which the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (one side of which is put in contact with the ribbed-roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) is fed. The ribbed roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is arranged so that the opposite spiral ribs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be directed to reduce the width of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferably the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comes close to the curved roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on its concave side, and leaves the curved roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on its convex side while maintaining a direction of the curved condition. The openings equalizing effect caused by the ribbed roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> depends on the bending curvature of the ribbed roll, the contact angle &agr;, the traveling-in angle &bgr; formed between the plane including a curved axis and the incoming net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the traveling-out angle &ggr; formed between the plane including a curved axis and the outgoing net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the tension of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the rib-to-rib distance, the rotating speed of the ribbed roll relative to the traveling web and other factors. Also, it should be noted that the ribbed roll need not be forcedly rotated, and that it is allowed to freely rotate when the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is traveling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The post-treatment means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprises a guide roll <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a pair of pinch rolls <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, an annealing roll <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and two guide rolls <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> arranged on the annealing roll <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The annealing roll <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is placed between the guide rolls <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the pinch rolls <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Thus, the travelling path the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> follows is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a fragmentary piece of split web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prior to expansion, whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows the fragmentary piece of net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> posterior to expansion. As shown, the prior-expansion web (split web) has a lot of short slits <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> longitudinally arranged, and the posterior-expansion web (net-like web) has oblique fibers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and counter-oblique fibers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> arranged therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> again, the expander <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used in expanding a triple-layered, split web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing a high density polyethylene in its center layer, and low density polyethylene in both surface layers thereof. The web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pulled out from the roll <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, starting laterally expanding the netlike web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and traveling to the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while increasing its width at a fixed expanding angle. The flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> rotates while keeping in contact with the traveling net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shuttles in its axial direction with the stroke of approximately 30 mm or below, thus limiting the expansion of the net-like web to relatively small amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> However, since the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pulled by the leading length to begin expanding at the guide roll <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to arrival at the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the action of expanding by the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is increasingly accumulated. The more the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expands, the more the oblique fibers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and counter oblique fibers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> incline (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The opening control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> effectively works the while, opening the openings into same size and form. Thus, the expansion ratio gradually converges toward a fixed value at which the width-expansion and the opening shaping-and-sizing are put in an equilibrium. A significantly large expansion ratio can be obtained by placing the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> apart from the tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a good distance. In this particular embodiment the expansion rate can be increased three to four times without difficulty. The net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is apt to be expanded much wider in its center area. To assure that the net-like web is expanded evenly from side to side, the expansion rate is set for approximately two times at the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Specifically the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is about two times as wide as the split web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the tension sensitive-and-adjustive roll <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is expanded still more at the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, where the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is expanded somewhat wider than required. The divergent angle is determined, largely depending on the kind or nature of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If the divergent angle is too large, the openings in the intermediate area of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are opened so wide that the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be torn easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The width of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prior to the upstream cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> varies depending on the kind of the web material, the tension of the web, and other factors. Also, the width of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is influenced by the on-and-off operation of the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As a result, the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prior to the downstream cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is too large or small in width. Sometimes the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaves the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> sideways, or the width of the net-like web grows irregular. To solve this problem a width-sensitive detector or sensor is put between the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, means for detecting the opening-and-closing frequency of the cloth guider <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be used. The signal from such sensor or detector is directed to a controller (not shown), which is responsive to the signal from the sensor or detector for feed-back automatically controlling the expansion of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the flat expander <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, thereby keeping the width of the net-like web <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> within limits at the detecting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> After the net-like web is expanded to the required width in the opening control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the strain of the net-like web caused by opening the openings into same size and form, is removed in the annealing roll <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, at the same time, the openings are uniformed by heat shrink action of the fibers, and fibers are distributed evenly. Then, the net-like web thus expanded is sent to the subsequent step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The flat expander commercially available in the name of &ldquo;Webster&rdquo; or &ldquo;Slat Expander&rdquo; can be used as the expander <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A cage-like roll, cloth guider, curved rubber roll, curved rod applicator, or screw roll may be equally used. Three or more pairs of cloth guiders may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Two ribbed-rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are used, but one ribbed-roll or three or more ribbed-rolls may be used to meet the occasional request. Straight ribbed-rolls are still effective in opening the openings into same size and form. The guide ribs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> need not be arranged continuously. It suffices that their arrangement is effective in guiding and reducing the net-like web in width no matter how they may be arranged. The width-sensitive sensor may be of the contact, photo-electric, image sensor, or pneumatic type or any other type. The most appropriate one for the particular kind of net-like web to be expanded may be selectively used. Screw rolls, bow rolls, and circular-arc rods (R bar) may be selectively used in combination. </paragraph>
