<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement for a protective helmet and more particularly for a helmet having at least two front protective shields that are moveable in rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background and Material Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Protective helmets have long been commonly used in different fields, whether professional, as is the case for military personnel, airplane or helicopter pilots, police officers or firemen, or civil or private use, as is the case for motorcycle users, rally or race car drivers, or construction workers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is no lack of applications and numerous helmets are already known which have a rigid outer shell having a substantially spherical shape, equipped with an inner lining, and adapted to nest around the user&apos;s cranium while providing a facial opening for his face at the front. These helmets generally have an inner envelope of synthetic foam adapted to absorb shocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Certain helmets also have facial shields adapted to promote the protection of the user&apos;s face while allowing him to observe external events. Thus, helmets provided with an external visor and an internal ocular shield are found in prior art. However, these helmets have numerous disadvantages that are linked to their manufacture, use or cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Indeed, it is usually difficult to obtain journals of facial shields on the outer shell and the prior art devices do not satisfy entirely given their frailty, complexity and lack of comfort during use. In addition, since protective helmets are developed to adapt to different types of users, any increase in the number of sizes necessarily implies obtaining an equal number of sizes for most of the accessories and attachments, especially for different facial shields, thus increasing the development cost of these helmets. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages by means that are simple, reliable, easy to implement and affordable. It has the objective of presenting a protective helmet having several facial shields, the journal configuration of the shields being simplified to allow easy manipulation thereof. This configuration also allows developing several different sizes of helmets while continuing to use a single shield size, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to its main feature, the protective helmet of the invention is of the type constituted by an outer shell adapted to protect the user&apos;s head and having at least two protective shields rotationally mobile with respect to the shell, and it is characterized in that a first shield is rotationally journalled on the shell, whereas a second shield is rotationally journalled on an intermediary connecting element attached to the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the shell, and the second shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the connecting element, and in that these two pivot axes are co-axial and are borne by the same transverse axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the main transverse axis bearing the journal axes is arranged in a zone located substantially at the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the rotational axes of the protective shields are not arranged in a co-axial manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield journalled on the shell is a large sized facial shield adapted to at least partially occupy, when it is in a position of use, a facial opening presented by the helmet, and in that the second shield journalled on the connecting element is an ocular shield adapted to be positioned into a position of use in front of the user&apos;s eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the connecting element is constituted of two lateral walls connected together by a portion of a spherical cap and is attached to the helmet shell so as to be immoveable with respect thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that the first shield is a facial shield assembled onto a shield support which extends it and which is journalled on the shell about a pivot axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has two lateral walls, both of them having an attaching member for the facial shield and a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with the journal axis attached to the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with a journal axis attached to the shell, and in that the opening and the axis have complementary indexing means adapted to index at least the two extreme positions of the facial shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that it has a rigid shock absorbing cap that is maintained in position in the upper portion of the shell, due at least partially to the connecting element.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) equipped with protective shields according to the invention can be of any type, such as, for example, of the type used by firemen, military personnel or motorcyclists, or even bicyclists or skiers. It has a main outer shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) that protects the user&apos;s cranium and nape, and it has a front facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) in the zone occupied by the user&apos;s face. The helmet has a generally symmetrical longitudinal vertical plane (P). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is of a rigid material and can be made of any appropriate material, such as plastic, steel, aluminum, or of a composite material of the type including a layering of reinforcement fibers that are impregnated and connected together by a resin matrix. According to the overall structure of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the outer shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), is constituted by a substantially spherical wall having several wall portions, namely, an upper front wall portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) extended rearwardly by an upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) which is itself extended downwardly by a lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and, in addition, it has two lateral wall portions: a right lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and a left lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The upper front portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s forehead and is limited by the upper edge (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) which in turn is limited laterally by two lateral edges (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s cranium, whereas the lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nape. Added to this is the fact that the wall of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is limited toward the bottom by a lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) correspond to the zones occupied by the user&apos;s ears and are limited towards the front by the corresponding lateral edge (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and toward the bottom by the front ends of the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has at least two protective shields (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), both shields being rotationally mobile with respect to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) between two positions, namely, between an active lowered position of use (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and an inactive raised position of non-use (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is journalled directly on the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled on a connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the helmet has a large sized facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) adapted to occupy the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) when it is in a position of use (B <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It also includes a smaller sized shield, called an ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), adapted to be positioned more specifically in front of the user&apos;s eyes when it is in a position of use (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle A open towards the front. The facial shield is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion having a radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle B open towards the front. The ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion with a radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Added to this is the fact that the angle A formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is greater than the angle B formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and that the radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is greater than the radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield is of a smaller size than the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield. Thus, the front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has a height (H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) measured in the generally symmetrical plane (P), which is greater than the height (H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) measured under the same conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield is journalled directly about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) integral with an intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal axes (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the two shields are advantageously arranged in each other&apos;s extension, i.e., they are borne by the same generally pivoting transverse axis (XX&prime;) that is substantially orthogonal to the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the helmet. It goes without saying that the two axes could be positioned in two separate locations so as to no longer be co-axial without leaving the scope of protection of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The intermediary element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is formed of two lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) connected together by a portion of a spherical cap (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). It is advantageously attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) at the lower end of its lateral walls so as to be immoveable with respect to the shell. The attachment of the connecting piece (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is done at two separate points of each of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) near the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of two screws (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with complementary housings (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) located on the inner surface of the shell, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal of the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is obtained co-axially in a zone located substantially at the level of the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. It is noted that in order to use the same type of facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) for the different shell sizes (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) itself is affixedly assembled to a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows extending the facial shield and which is journalled on the pivot axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) arranged on the inner surface of the shell. Thus, to develop several helmet sizes, a facial shield of one size is used and is adapted to be installed on any helmet by means of a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows adapting the shield to all sizes of shells (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by lengthening the journal arms. This support element (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) is in the shape of an arc (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) that extends between two lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), which each have an attaching member for the facial shield, such as affixing tabs arranged in a circular manner and projecting in toward the helmet to cooperate with an opening (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) located at the end of the facial shield itself, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) also have, at their lower end, a journal opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with the journal axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is noted that the shape of the opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) is not round but polygonal, thus allowing it to cooperate with complementary indexing means described hereinafter, which allow indexing the specific positions of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), such as the active position (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the raised position (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet, the indexing means and the journal axis are obtained from the same element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) that is attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of a known screw system (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and housing for attachments (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). This journal and indexing element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) includes an assembly of ramps and projections adapted to index at least two extreme positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) due, in particular, to the elastic deformation of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) that are distanced one from the other when their opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the ramps cooperate to allow pivoting between the two extreme indexed positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the latter has a rigid shock absorbing cap (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) made of polyurethane foam, for example, and adapted to occupy the upper portion of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). This car. (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is advantageously maintained in position in the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) due to the intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the helmet that is not shown, the journal axes of the two shields are no longer co-axial but occupy a separate position, the journal axis of the facial shield being arranged on the shell and that of the ocular shield being arranged on the intermediary connecting element in different positions. The facial shield is mounted on its support and thus allows extending the shield up to its journal axis, whereas the ocular shield is journalled about a journal axis of a traditional type which has no specific indexing means, but whose shield position can be blocked due to the friction between the axis and the shield while pivoting. It is noted that the ocular shield can also be provided with indexing means that are similar or dissimilar to those of the outer facial shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) has a maneuvering handle (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) arranged on the lower edge of the ocular shield near the journal axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) which bears it and the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) so as to allow the user to activate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to correctly define the pivoting positions and to protect the indexing means which can be arranged on the two shields (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), it is noted that an abutment system which limits the pivoting of one or both shields downwardly and/or upwardly could also be provided. Added to this is the fact that the pivoting of one or both shields could be free or stopped, such as, for example, by friction at the level of its journal (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) or elsewhere in an appropriate zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the drawings, it is noted that the ocular shield and more specifically its front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has, during pivoting, a very short trajectory such that this shield is very close to the user&apos;s face, and especially to the eyes, just like ordinary glasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In fact, a central cutout (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), open downwardly, is advantageously provided, and is adapted for the passage of the user&apos;s nose. Furthermore, a comfort and finishing joint can be provided on the lower edge of the shield. The facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has, during its pivoting, a trajectory that is naturally farther apart which allows the shield to move forwardly beyond the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the user could individually place either of the two in a lowered or raised position, or both shields at the same time, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in particular. It is noted that the helmet advantageously has an inner cap (not shown) adapted for the user&apos;s comfort and correct positioning of the helmet. In the rear part of the helmet, this cap is advantageously attached directly to the attaching members arranged on the inner surface of the shell, whereas in the front part of the helmet, it is attached to the intermediary connecting element which bears the ocular shield and its journal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and represented by way of examples, and it also includes any technical equivalents as well as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The instant application is based upon the French priority Patent Application No. 00 06822, filed May 29, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference thereto, and the priority of which is hereby claimed under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to face guards for sporting helmets. More particularly, this invention relates to a face guard for football helmets manufactured using titanium wire and to a method for manufacturing such face guards. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional face guards or masks for protective helmets, such as football helmets, are typically manufactured using steel wire or steel tubing. Steel-based face guards desire improvement as they are relatively heavy and prone to corrosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention advantageously relates to a face guard made of titanium wire having advantageous weight and corrosion-resistance characteristics as compared to steel-based face guards. The invention further relates to a method for producing face guards made of titanium wire in an manner that is uncomplicated and cost effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved face guard for protective helmets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a face guard of the character described for use with football helmets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that weighs less than conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is less prone to corrosion as compared to conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is made using titanium wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is economical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing face guards of the character described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With regard to the foregoing and other objects, the present invention is directed to a method of making a face mask including the steps of providing a plurality of lengths of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches; forming each length at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle; and welding each of the thus formed lengths to at least one other of the lengths in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention relates to a face mask including a plurality of wire members interconnected to one another. Each wire member includes a length of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches. Each wire member is formed at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle. Each of the formed members is welded to at least one other of the members in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention advantageously enables manufacture of titanium face masks in a cost-effective and uncomplicated manner. Face masks in accordance with the invention are lighter in weight than conventional steel-based face masks and offer numerous advantages to conventional face masks.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the foregoing lengths are for a preferred embodiment only and that the wires may be of various other lengths depending on the desired configuration and size of the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The members are next formed, preferably at room temperature (e.g., about 50 to about 80&deg; F.), to impart a desired shape to each of the wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the desired configuration preferably being that shown for the members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this regard, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably formed into member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by first bending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as by rotary bending using a die of desired dimension to achieve a desired formed resented by the angle A, of about 159 degrees and a center-line radius (CL) of about 4.34 inches. The formed wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is substantially symmetrical and bilateral, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will be noted, ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially outside of the bend imparted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably about 2 inches in length and are formed as explained below using press brake bending equipment to achieve the final configuration of the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Returning to the initial manipulation of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired formed degree of bend, it has been experienced that a formed degree of bend of 159 degrees for the member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be achieved using a die having a radius of about 3.195 inches and overbending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a degree of bend A&prime;, shown in phantom, of about 206 degrees. Thus, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must be significantly bent past the desired formed degree of bend to impart the desired bend. The foregoing described bend and the similar bends described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably made using rotary bending apparatus and at room temperature.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As will be noted from Table 3, for bends formed using the described press bending apparatus, the ratio of the degree of bend applied to that of the formed bend is generally between about 1.05 and 1.16 and, is most preferably between about 1.07 and 1.15. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is surprising that welds of suitable strength to achieve a face mask compliant with the relevant standards of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) such as the NOCSAE Standard Method of Impact and Performance Requirements for Football Faceguards were achievable. It is known that titanium is highly reactive and would not be expected to provide suitable weld strength when welded in a reactive environment, such as in the presence of oxygen. As will be appreciated, the ability to achieve suitable weld strength in this manner achieves considerable cost savings as compared to welding in a non-reactive environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the settings set forth in Table 3 were important to achieving suitable weld strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After welding, the guard is removed from the fixture and all wire terminations ground using silicon carbide sandpaper to a full radius to avoid sharp ends. The face guard is thereafter cleaned, primed with a bonding agent, such as a lacquer basic phenolic bonding agent, and coated with vinyl to a thickness of from about 0.02 to about 0.09 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When used for football helmets, face guards in accordance with the invention should be tested for compliance with the afore-mentioned NOCSAE standard. Likewise, compliance with any other relevant standards or criteria should be determined dependent upon the intended use of the face guard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A face guard constructed as described herein was observed to have a weight less than that of conventional steel wire and steel tubing face guards. For example, a similarly configured face guard made from steel wire of the same diameter (0.225 inches) would have a weight of over about 16 ounces, uncoated, and one made from steel tubing having an outside diameter of about 0.25 inches (i.d. 0.160 inches) would have a weight of at least about 11 ounces, uncoated. The foregoing described face guard of the invention has a weight of about 9 ounces, uncoated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It has also been observed that face guards made in accordance with the invention are more resistant to corrosion than conventional steel and steel tubing face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention advances the art by enabling the production of face guards made of titanium wire which have desirable qualities and which may be produced in an economical and uncomplicated manner. It has been stated in the prior art that face guards could be made using titanium containing materials. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,082 states that the face mask thereof &ldquo;is usually cast with thin cross sections as a single piece and hardened using high strength alloys (e.g. titanium, 4140 steel, 4140 stainless steel, etc.).&rdquo; Col. 5, lines 2-4. U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,088 describes a face guard of metal tubes construction, with a metal tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereof made of steel, or of other metals or metal alloys (metal mixtures) such as aluminum, carbon, cobalt, chromium, iron, nickel, tin titanium and zinc. Co, 4, lines 7-1 1. It is believed that prior attempts to manufacture face guards using titanium containing materials have resulted in face guards that are unsuitable for their intended purpose and/or of such expense so at to be commercially unfeasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It has unexpectedly been discovered that face guards of desirable characteristics may be economically produced in accordance with the invention. For example, in accordance with the invention, it has been discovered that face guards having desirable characteristics may be manufactured using Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches, most preferably from about 0.224 to about 0.225 inches. For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the selection of this particular material in the afore-mentioned diameter range was important to achieving the purposes of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for purposes of illustration only, and it is understood that numerous modifications or alterations may be made in and to the illustrated embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to gloves for the human hand which are worn when playing sports such as baseball, softball, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to a batting glove specifically designed to improve grip, comfort, protection, and performance of a wearer. However, this invention has broader implications and may be advantageously employed in other applications requiring protection of the hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Glove construction for protection of the human hand is well known. In addition, there are a number of patents which teach gloves claimed to be particularly useful as batting gloves. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,175,226 teaches a dress glove construction which completely covers the fingers and which includes resiliently expandable materials in selected areas to accommodate hands of different sizes. In contrast, U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,122 teaches a protective glove which has a wrap around construction for a protective glove which leaves the thumb and fingers ends exposed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,345,609 teaches a protective glove which includes shock absorbing cells disposed at selected portions along the top of the glove. U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,980 teaches a hand glove with a polyurethane foam pad in the palm portion of the glove. Other references attempt to provide a sport glove for supporting and stabilizing the wrist and hand. Current gloves protect the bony prominence areas of the hand. Although hand protection from direct shocks and abrasions is found in gloves of the current art, what is needed is a batting glove which provides improved grip, comfort and performance by unloading bony prominences, unloading pulleys and tendons, and improving finger and knuckle motion of the hand of a wearer by providing preselected thicknesses of preselected materials specifically chosen to protect the wearer from injury from distributed shocks in hitting a ball with a bat, and the attendant risk of long-term injury to the aforementioned bones, ligaments, pulleys, tendons, etc., by repetitive swinging of bats and hitting of balls. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove which takes stress off of selected parts of the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove having preselected materials of construction in different areas of contact with the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove having preselected thicknesses of preselected materials of construction in different areas of contact with the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove which uses different materials to allow wrist motion, unload bony prominences, improve finger and knuckle motion, and protect the back of the hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention provides a batting glove including preselected material in preselected thicknesses to fill in the soft spots surrounding the bony prominences of the hand, to unload the pulleys and tendons, and to take stress off of selected parts of the hand. Specifically, 2-Way SPANDEX&reg; materials are used in the wrist motion zone of the glove; thin elastic material such as LYCRA&reg; is used in the area of the finger joints and knuckles; synthetic material such as JANEC SUPER&reg; is used in the area of the dorsal side of the fingers; a cabretta skin protective covering is used for selected parts of the hand, rubber foam protective padding is placed at selected contact areas, and soft padding such as terry cotton is placed inside the glove in selected areas. </paragraph>

The thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes the flexor tendon (flexor pollicis longus) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the three pulleys <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and A3 pulley <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is the most important for function and is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The respective pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are also shown for each of the: index finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, long finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, ring finger <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and small finger <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has five pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are considered to be the most important for function. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is attached to the middle phalanx <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is near the MCP joint <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is near the PIP joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is near the DIP joint <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are shown as one unit for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, but actually there are two flexor tendons to each unit. They are the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus (shown as one, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). These tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> travel underneath the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and attach to the distal phalanx <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> move back and forth below the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, via muscles (not shown) attached to the proximal end of the tendons. This movement of the tendon <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> produces finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. The pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> prevent the flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from bowstringing or moving away from the bone with finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. If the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are damaged and no longer function, the tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will bowstring with a resultant significant loss of finger motion as well as grip strength. As such, pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, especially the A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, are very important and must be preserved and protected as much as possible. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, protective padding <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is placed in an anatomically designed fashion over the A2 and A4 pulley regions. When the A2 and A4 pulleys <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are preserved, adequate finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> motion and grip strength is maintained. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an adjustable, disposable garment protector useful to protect the garments of a user from spills, dropped food and the like during the consumption of food and beverages, particularly fast food beverages. The invention also relates to a convertible food bag and a method for packaging the disposable garment protector and a method for disposing of the disposable garment protector and its contents after use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE MENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Garment protectors have been used to protect the front of infants during feeding or dining and diners eating particularly messy foods such as lobsters and the like for many years. However, most such garment protectors simply consist of a cloth-like garment protector supported at the back of the neck of a user and do nothing to catch liquids or foods which may be spilled on the garment protector and pass downwardly over the surface of the garment protector and onto the garments of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such garment protectors do not serve the needs of modern consumers who frequently purchase food at fast food drive-ins or drive-throughs for consumption in an automotive vehicle while moving on crowded roadways and the like. Garment protectors for such use should not only be easily disposable but they should also provide a means for containing any waste materials spilled and provide for a method of disposing of both any spilled food particles, liquids and the like as well as the garment protector itself after the user has finished dining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a continuing search has been directed to the development of a disposable garment protector which protects the garments of a user while dining in automobiles, school cafeterias, offices, picnicking, or like activities and provides for the disposal of any spilled or dropped food particles, liquids or packaging and for the disposal of the garment protector itself. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, an adjustable disposable garment protector is provided and comprises a protector support adapted to support the garment protector from the neck of a user; a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user; and, a pouch positioned on the second end of the protector cover, the pouch having a top end and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a first closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end opened and positioned to collect particulates and liquids moving downwardly along the front surface of the garment protector in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The garment protector may also be fabricated as a convertible food bag which is convertible into an adjustable disposable garment protector, the convertible food bag comprising a food bag having a front and a back, a first side and a second side, a top and a bottom, a disposable garment protector support adapted to support the disposable garment protector from the neck of a user, a pouch formed by a lower portion of the bag and having a top and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end open and a tearable perforation or a cut across the front, first side and second side of the bag so that the bag above the top of the pouch is foldable to a closed position to form a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the description of the Figures the same numbers will be used throughout to refer to the same or similar components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> an adjustable, disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. Garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adapted to support garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in position about the neck of a user. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes at least one perforation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (two are shown) which are included to permit rapid removal of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the event of an emergency. Perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are positioned near the upper part of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which would be near the back of the user. Perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could also be placed at any place along the length of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also includes a plurality of creases <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which may be bent at a first crease and doubled back at another crease and stuck to adhesive patches <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to shorten support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At least one adhesive patch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to facilitate shortening support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this fashion. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defines an opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in its center which is the space occupied by the neck of the user as the disposable garment protector is positioned for use. This center section may comprise a napkin material which is readily removed by breaking perforations surrounding center <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or it may comprise a sheet containing games for the amusement of children or adults and the like. The center napkin or the like is perforated for removal without tearing perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The center <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as well as other surfaces of the disposable garment protector, may be used for advertising, decorative materials or the like. In fact it is contemplated that most of the exposed surfaces of the disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be used for advertising or decorative materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported by support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is configured to cover a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user. The protector cover section desirably comprises an absorbent towel or napkin-like soft, absorbent material <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on its front surface. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</cross-reference>, a water-impervious layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is desirably positioned on a portion of a back <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Typically the impervious layer extends behind the lower portion of garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for example below a dotted line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends downwardly to its bottom <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to be the same as a bottom <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of a pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a front <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a first side <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a second side <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and is positioned generally at the bottom of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A plurality of creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be positioned in protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a folded position so that protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be pulled downwardly to unfold creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to lengthen protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is generally a fold-out pouch, is shown to fold out in a fashion similar to the bottom of a paper bag. As shown more fully in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of folds <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are positioned at sides <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be folded to a closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> with its bottom positioned near a front surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, fold-out inner pouches <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are shown by dotted lines. These pouches may be positioned to be folded out by the user inside pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or designed as an integral part of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to fold out as desired by the user to hold barbeque sauce, catsup, salad dressing, or the like. The use of the inner pouches is optional but may be desirable in many instances. Further, a plurality of fold-out inner pouches may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> side view of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown. Adhesive strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in combination with creases <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to shorten protector cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shown in a closed (initial) position. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in its open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in a closed position and folded against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are in their open position to lengthen protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an alternate configuration of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown. This pouch folds differently but includes a fold <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and collapses against protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which also collapses against the front of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is basically a slipover design where support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constitutes a single strap which may be adjusted by creases and adhesives. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> two straps are shown. The straps are joined to a first side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of a first end <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (top) of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are overlapped with an end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of a first strap and an end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of a second strap. The straps can be joined by VELCRO, adhesives or as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by a snap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or the like. In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shown. A variety of fasteners can be used such as VELCRO, adhesives, snaps, buttons, tying, the use of a continuous strap with a slipover fit and the like. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are shown in each side of a strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A single perforation could be used, and two straps could be used but for convenience a plurality of perforations is shown in a slip-over strap. In this embodiment, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be shortened by tearing one of the perforations on each side and moving the end (strap tear end) of the strap removed at the perforation to engage a adhesive shown at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. By selection of the desired perforation, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be shortened to any desired length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In other respects, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is similar to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> food bag convertible to become a disposable garment protector is shown. The food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a top <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and first and second sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>respectively. A support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is positioned to extend above back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, during use of the bag, support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent downwardly along the back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In this configuration the bag is readily used to serve food and the like. Bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a cut <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or a perforation which is easily tearable along front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, but strong enough to permit use of the bag as a container. This permits the bag sections above top <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be separated and folded back against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A clip or tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of a suitable deformable material such as treated paper or the like is positioned on the top of back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> for deformation to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be of the same material as bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and may be insertable into a slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; inside <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for mating engagement with tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position. In this configuration, the bag is readily used as a disposable garment protector. The bag may also be fabricated from a clear plastic or the like so that the contents of the bag can be seen by the purchaser. Bags of this type are also suitable for conversion to a garment protector as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 a</cross-reference> cross-section of the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown. A front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprises a soft, absorbent material such as a towel or napkin-like material which has suitable strength to form support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A backing <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is positioned by bonding it to the back of the front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This configuration permits the bag to be fabricated economically by placing the water repellant material only on the lower portion of the disposable garment protector where it is needed rather than behind the front of the entire disposable garment protector. Of course, no such backing is required when a plastic bag is used. Such fabricaton techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Various adhesives have been referred to in the discussion of the present invention. These adhesives are adhesive strips which are preferably covered with a peelable or otherwise readily removable covering so that the adhesive is not activated until it is desired by the user to do so. Such adhesives are readily available and form no part of the present invention except as they may function in conjunction with other components of the collapsible garment protector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shown near the top of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This strip is used to retain the disposable garment protector in a rolled-up position when the user has finished with it. When the user has finished his meal, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to close pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The pouch then contains any spilled or discarded materials or the like which have been placed in pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can also be used for the disposal of napkins, empty packages and the like consistent with the size of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has been closed, the garment protector may be rolled into a tight roll and retained in the tight roll by use of adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This permits the economical use of space in a vehicle with the waste materials from the meal contained in the disposable garment protector. Similarly tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may be formed as an adhesive tab and used in a similar fashion or an adhesive tab may be used in lieu of tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By the use of the present invention, a user may safely purchase and consume fast food products while occupying a vehicle or the like without risk of soiling the users&apos; garments. After the disposable garment protector has been used, it can then be utilized to store spills and other refuse from the consumed meal in a fashion consistent with the maintenance of neatness in the vehicle and the like until an opportunity to dispose of the disposable garment protector is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The disposable garment protectors may be stored in flat containers from which they are removed sequentially by use of a tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The tab in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is adapted to be grasped by a user of the disposable garment protector, or a third party dispersing the disposal garment protector to a user, for the removal of a disposable garment protector from a storage box, drawer or the like in which the disposable garment protectors are positioned as flat stackable disposable garment protectors. Alternatively, the disposable garment protector may be folded at lines such as line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and at perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> if folded with pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facing downwardly along line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being folded upwardly and over the remaining portions of disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at perforation <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;. The disposable garment protectors may be placed in a smaller container and again may be removed by grasping tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which may comprise a covered adhesive tab. This permits the storage of disposable garment protectors in a smaller container which may be somewhat taller but occupies a smaller horizontal space than when the disposable garment protectors are stacked in the flattened form. Many variations in the packaging of disposable products, such as the adjustable disposable garment protectors, are possible and well-known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Having thus described the present invention by reference to certain of its preferred embodiments, it is pointed out that many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is broadly concerned with therapy apparel for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and/or impaired motor development. The apparel is designed to be worn during the course of a therapy session, and has been found to yield many benefits to children under such treatment. The preferred therapy apparel includes a top worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child with a series of flexible, stretchable elastic straps designed for selective placement around the child&apos;s feet and knees during different therapy exercises, and for grasping and lateral extension by the child. The top is adorned with fanciful theme decorations thereon to arouse the child&apos;s interest and fulfill play needs. The overall apparel further includes a cape and specialized, close-fitting headgear, which again are appropriately theme-decorated. The headgear is designed to permit the child to attach various fanciful accouterments to excite the child and enhance motor skill development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Sensory integrative dysfunction is a developmental disorder defined by deficits in the central processing of proprioceptive, tactile, and vestibular sensory inputs that are not attributable to either peripheral or cortical central nervous system dysfunction. The proprioceptive sense refers to components of muscles, joints, and tendons that provide a person with a subconscious awareness of body position and movement. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have difficulty maintaining balance in relation to environmental demands and have difficulty with tasks that require opposing muscle groups to work in a coordinated fashion, such as wringing out a wash cloth or pouring milk from a heavy container. The tactile sense interprets applied stimuli such as touch, pressure, pain, and temperature, through tactile receptors found throughout the skin. Some children are overly sensitive to touch, particularly light touch and have a tendency to react negatively and with extreme emotion to some tactile sensations. On the other hand, some children crave tactile input, touching and seeking out input. The vestibular sense is responsible for awareness of body position and movement in space, postural tone and equilibrium, and stabilization of the eyes in space during head movements. The vestibular receptors are located in the inner ear and are stimulated by movement of the head and by gravity. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have balance difficulties and cannot tolerate or interpret movement, while others seem to crave movement opportunities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sensory integration theory postulates that intervention through therapy provides enhanced sensory experience within the context of a meaningful, self-directed activity in order to elicit an adaptive behavior. The result is enhanced sensory integration and, in turn, enhanced learning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One method of proprioceptive and tactile sensory stimulation is deep pressure or deep touch pressure. Deep touch pressure is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of firm touching, holding, and stroking. One investigator observed this need for deep pressure from a girl with autism as she would hug her mother with strong, firm hugs. Her mother indicated that her child favored clothing that covered her limbs and was made from cotton knit fabric. Her mother would often dress the child in a jumper or skirt over cotton knit, flowered longjohns. The need to cover the limbs with fabric that hugs the body is characteristic of the child who needs continuous tactile input. In contrast, a four-year-old male with autism was observed who did not like clothing. He would remove his shirt, socks, and shoes, and pull his pant legs up as far as possible. These are characteristic of tactile defensiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Weighted vests, weighted collars, weighted arms and leg bands, lap and shoulder weights, and weighted quilts are available for treating deep pressure needs. One investigator conducted a pilot study applying weighted vests with two samples, children with autism and children without autism. The non-autistic children reported that wearing the vest made them feel sleepy, but showed no appreciable change in pulse or blood pressure; whereas, the children with autism had measurable drops in both pulse rate and blood pressure reading. While the wearing of weighted vests are increasing in elementary schools and therapy treatment programs, the outcomes of wearing weighted vests are largely anecdotal and few parameters exist to guide the use of the vests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Gloves and pressure vests have been shown to reduce self-stimulatory behaviors of a young girl with autism. Similarly, self-injurious and self-stimulating behaviors of a boy with autism were reduced while wearing arm splints and elastic bandages. A calming effect provided by the direct pressure has been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An adult with autism has reported that deep pressure applied to her body provides a calming effect. A squeeze machine was designed to provide great amounts of pressure over her body. The squeeze machine&apos;s pressure also had a relaxing effect on adults without disability. Use of the squeeze machine also led to a reduction in hyperactivity in four of nine children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The foregoing indicates that deep pressure and tactile input is calming for children with sensory impairments and that apparel and textile products may be used as therapeutic aids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing expedients have been used in the past in an attempt to provide appropriate therapy for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction, the prior apparel and the like has not fulfilled the play and imaginative needs of small children; moreover, the prior therapy garments do not generally provide the full range of desirable therapy inputs for the treatment of sensory integration dysfunctions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides therapy apparel for small children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and impaired motor development. Broadly speaking, the therapy apparel includes a flexible top adapted to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child requiring therapy, with the top having upper shoulder sections and a neck opening therebetween, and front and rear panels depending from the shoulder sections and presenting lower margins. The top includes a pair of flexible, stretchable first straps extending below the panel lower margins with each first strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s feet while the child is standing. In this orientation, the first straps cause the top and straps to be pulled downwardly to provide deep pressure therapy input. Preferably, each of the first straps is in the form of a continuous loop passing adjacent a shoulder section of the top and with the lower end of each loop adapted for passing under a respective foot of the child; in this way, upwardly directed forces are generated to give upward pressure and proprioceptive input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In further preferred forms, the top has a pair of flexible, stretchable second straps likewise extending below the lower margin of the top with each second strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s knees when the child is in a tall kneeling position; these second straps are also configured to cause the top strap to be pulled downwardly in this orientation. The second straps are likewise in the form of continues loops which pass adjacent a shoulder section and with the lower end of the loops adapted for coupling with the child&apos;s knees, to generated upwardly forces. Finally, the top also includes a third pair of flexible, stretchable, loop-type lateral straps each selectively extensible in opposed lateral directions beyond the side sections of the top and grasped by the child. These lateral straps when extended cause the top to be pulled in corresponding lateral directions, creating resistance against the child&apos;s hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder joints and coordinating muscles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The front and rear panels of the top are preferably provided with fanciful theme decorations thereon, such as insects (e.g. beetles), aquatic animals with fins, scales and eyes, animals having horns, ears, noses, eyes and tails, royalty with crowns, and wands, workers such as firemen, policemen, mail carriers, construction workers and cowboys, and shapes, colors and textures of various types (squares, circles, triangles, ovals and the like). Furthermore, in order to provide a further measure of deep pressure input, the front and back panels of the top are provided with pockets which receive weights of various sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The preferred apparel also includes a cape to be worn over the top with the cape having a neckpiece and a pair of opposed, outwardly extending wing sections, the latter each having a handhold. The outer surface of the cape is equipped with differently manipulable objects which can be grasped and used by the child, in order to provide fine motor development. The outer surface of the cape is also preferably decorated in a manner corresponding to the decorations provided on the apparel top </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, the therapy apparel includes headgear which is stretchable and equipped with a chin strap so that the headgear may be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. The headgear further has a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments each attachable to the exterior surface of the headgear at the discretion of the child. For this purpose, a headgear preferably has a central panel and opposed side panels, with stretchable fabric interconnecting the panels; the outer surface of the panels, and the corresponding ends of the accouterments, have mating hook and loop Velcro&reg; fabric sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The therapy apparel of the invention allows full body movement by the child to facilitate participation in all occupational activities and use of occupational/physical therapy equipment. Moreover, the apparel provides opportunities for active proprioceptive input, allows for passive and deep pressure proprioceptive input, promotes use of equipment to provide vestibular input and generates desirable tactile input. Use of the therapy apparel promotes gross, fine and perceptual motor skills along with motor planning up to three stages, and enhances transitions without behavior resistance from the child between activities, thus aiding in the wearer&apos;s self-organization and attention to task. Finally, the apparel meets the play needs of the child, with structures and forms revolving around play themes favored by children.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, and particularly <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, therapy apparel broadly referred to by the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided, which is worn by a child <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Broadly speaking, the apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a sleeveless fabric top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of the child <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a flexible, close-fitting headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) includes a pair of upper padded raglan shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a neckhole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> therebetween, and a pair of depending front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> depending from the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pair of large arm holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed below the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with respective side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> below the corresponding arm holes. The panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form a continuous lower margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The entire top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is constructed to have a lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of appropriately sewn-together fabric (e.g., cotton spandex knit), an interlining to internally organize the straps (polyester knit interfacing), as well as a fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is likewise sewn-together. The fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed using any desired fabric such as gold spandex, and is adorned with fanciful theme decorations, such as a &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design on the front and rear panels. In addition, a series of openings are provided in the fabric <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for receipt of stretchable straps which extend between the outer fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In particular, lower slit openings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are provided in the front and rear panels adjacent margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, along with upper slit openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of each shoulder section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Elongated lateral slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided on the front and rear panels adjacent the armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Finally, somewhat shorter lateral slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed in the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> accommodate a total of three pairs of elongated, continuous-loop stretchable straps formed of elastic, which extend through corresponding channels in the top which are interlined with polyester knit interfacing. Specifically, a first pair of leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, so that the upper ends of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> overly the corresponding shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extend below margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, each of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a short, flexible elastic segment <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> adjacent the lower end thereof, defining corresponding foot-receiving openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A second set of somewhat shorter knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are threaded through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> but lie within the confines of the longer leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have a hanging length of about 27 &frac12; inches when relaxed, whereas the knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> have a relaxed hanging length of about 20&frac12; inches. A hold-down strap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is secured at the lower margin side in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A pair of upper and lower lateral continuous loop straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are also supported by the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and in the illustrated embodiment have a relaxed length of 23 inches. As illustrated, the upper strap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends through the arcuate slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, whereas the lower strap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> passes through the slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A hold down strap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is secured to the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the lower sections of armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in place when not in use. The hold down straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are selectively releasable via hook and loop (Velcro&reg;) material respectively secured to the inner surface of the straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the outer fabric of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the interlining <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>preferably formed of polyester knit interfacing which are attached to lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upright pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend from the shoulder regions downwardly towards margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and are sewn with stitching <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to define corresponding open-ended strap channels <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which receive the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The piece <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>overlies the pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and is attached by stitching <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> defining upper and lower open-ended, lateral channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which respectively receive straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Although not illustrated, it will be appreciated that the rear panel of the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also equipped with interlining as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, so that the loop straps <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are supported front and rear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is equipped with a pair of side-by side open top pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> which are designed to receive weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Such weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably correspond with the fanciful theme of the surface decoration of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, in the case of the &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; theme, the weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> would be in the form of baby bugs having a surface decoration including fabric &ldquo;wings&rdquo; as well as extensible &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; (not shown). The weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be provided in different sizes (e.g. &frac14; and &frac12; pound) are preferably formed of fabric and are filled with metal pellets or other weighting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The overall apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an exterior fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an inner lining surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Again, the exterior surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is advantageously consistent in its design with the fanciful theme of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, this exterior surface would have a similar &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design along the central portion of the cape outer surface. In more detail, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a central neckpiece <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of selectively interconnectable straps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided with matable hook and loop fabric pieces <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In addition, the cape has a central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as well as outwardly extending wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The inner surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the cape has a pair of hand holds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which can be grasped by the child to extend the cape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The inner lining of the cape has a pair of Velcro&reg; straps designed to mate with corresponding Velcro&reg; straps <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> provided on the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The outer fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also provided with differently manipulable objects which can be manipulated and used by the child. Specifically, the central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> has a zippered pocket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as well as an adjacent button-closed pocket <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The wing section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a lacing assembly <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of elongated fabric sections <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> provided with eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>; a lacing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is threaded through the eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and conventionally knotted. The wing section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the other hand has a zipper assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of fabric sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> interconnected by an elongated separating zipper <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is designed as a close-fitting head covering and includes a pair of padded side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a padded central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are formed of padded fabric with the exterior surfaces thereof formed of Velcro&reg; loop material. A pair of elongated, stretchable elastic sections <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> interconnect the central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to allow a stretch fit on the head of a child. A chin strap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a mating Velcro&reg; outer end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends between the side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and allows the headgear to be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also provided with a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> each having a base <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> formed of mating Velcro&reg; fabric, allowing the respective accouterments to be attached to any desired point on the panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, at the discretion of the child. The accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be of virtually any appropriate configuration, consistent with the fanciful decorations on the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, it will be seen that the accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> include wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, eyes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, antennae <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of various sizes and configurations, and small weighted bugs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In use, the therapy apparel is donned by the child, with assistance from the therapist. First, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is put on, with the therapist selecting appropriate weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for insertion into the pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are donned, with the chin strap of the latter being drawn to ensure that the headgear is in close fitting relationship to the child&apos;s head. The child is then encouraged to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the child&apos;s discretion. This is of course readily accomplished owing to the construction of the accouterments having bases <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which are attachable to the outer surface of the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides low level protection and sensory input and integration (tactile, proprioceptive and vestibular). The opportunity to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> gives motor development opportunities, appeals to the play needs of the child and enhances the opportunity for social interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Actual observations of children wearing the therapy apparel of the invention demonstrates that the garments enable children to function at a higher attention level and skill level during therapy. One subject had difficulty managing his behavior, organizing himself and staying on task. When wearing the apparel, there was a noticeable improvement in the subject&apos;s behavior, which is believed to have occurred because the elastic straps and/or weights provided the correct amount of arousal, modulation and discrimination, all leading to skill output. Another major benefit was that use of the Bootstraps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> notably decreased the subject&apos;s toe walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fanciful design on the apparel promoted the use of vestibular integrating suspended equipment. Several subjects pretended they were &ldquo;flying&rdquo; and used suspended swings as flying vehicles. The duration of time the subjects spent in the suspended equipment increased with continued wearing of the therapy apparel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A variety of tactile opportunities were provided by the various different fabrics and other different materials used in the construction of the apparel. As the children interacted with the apparel they received tactile input from the elastic straps, hugging the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to their bodies, throwing the bug weights, placing items in the top and cape pockets, and manipulating the cape&apos;s zippers, button and lacing assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Fine and perceptual motor skill activity in the subjects increased by interaction with the cape&apos;s fastening system and the zippers, button, button hole, Velcro&reg; sections and lacing. Resistance-free transitions were observed between gross motor and fine motor activities and motor planning was promoted by using the cape to store fine motor activities. The subjects planned activities retrieved the objects for the activities, stored objects in the cape&apos;s pockets, participated in gross motor activity and then removed the objects from the cape&apos;s pockets for fine motor activity. Using the top and cape pockets promoted smooth transitions and organization of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The play needs of the wearers were satisfied with the &ldquo;bug superhero&rdquo; theme, and the apparel stimulated the desire to engage in imaginative play while also allowing the therapist to incorporate therapy goal activities. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform having highly visible patches or targets which will lie superimposed over the most vital points of contact on the body of the wearer. The combatants, during practice, may then accurately aim non-contact kicks and punches at these most vital points on their opponent&apos;s body so as to practice rendering their opponent incapacitated in the most efficient manner. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many of the martial arts, for example, jiu jitsu, karate, etc., participants prepare for engaging an opponent in unarmed combat. Such preparation often requires years of diligent training and practice in order to become effective. The participants become disciplined, coordinated and generally more physically fit and potentially lethal during repetitive exercises for example those simulating the striking attack upon an opponent or the defense to such an attack upon the participant. In that the combatants are unarmed, the combatants will each have the same areas of vulnerability inherent in the human form, all other things being equal. The successful combatant will be the one who can strike most effectively through the opponent&apos;s defenses so as to land an accurately focused forceful blow, kick or the like to vulnerable points on the opponent&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the prior art of which applicant is aware, it is known to train for martial arts combat by physically striking at resilient targets which are meant to simulate striking parts of an opponent&apos;s body. It is also known to provide resilient padding for combatant&apos;s bodies so that the force from blows which are exchanged is absorbed by the padding. As an example of the former, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 4,991,231 which issued to Swift on Feb. 12, 1991 for a Karate Target Pad. As an example of the latter, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,649 which issued Mar. 26, 1996 to Queppet for a Martial Arts Training Pad and Blocking Shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Applicant is also aware of attempts in the prior art to provide targets on padding used for martial arts training, for example such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,866,909 which issued to DeSantis on Feb. 18, 1975 for a Protective Garment for Karate with Force Indicating Members Thereon, and Canadian laid-open Patent Application No. 2,261,472 to Dabney, laid open Aug. 13, 1999 and entitled &ldquo;Protective Target Apparatus to Aid in the Practice of Martial Arts&rdquo;. With respect to the DeSantis teaching, it is taught to provide a uniform for combatants engaging in full-contact karate and the like, where the uniform consists of a helmet and a torso-protective garment having a plurality of pockets mounted on the helmet and the garment at positions corresponding to vulnerable parts of the covered portions of the combatants. Inflated plastic bags are placed into the pockets so as to be ruptured upon impact by a blow of predetermined force. The ruptured plastic bag emits a noise indicating the successful strike. What is neither taught nor suggested is the use of flexible targets, such as those taught herein, which may be distributed over a uniform so as to cover many of the vulnerable points not located on the torso, and which would prove to be cumbersome to cover using the device of DeSantis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Applicant notes that DeSantis does not suggest covering the arms and legs of the combatant with a protective garment having air-bag receiving pockets, as such would likely not prove practical and would inhibit the freedom of motion of those limbs. Contrary to the teaching of DeSantis, it is taught herein, and it is one object of the present invention to provide, a Gi which, as with conventional Gis, covers the arms and legs of the user. The Gi has positioned thereon, flexible and soft targets indicating the vulnerable spots on not only the torso, but also the limbs of the user. In the present invention, the target-bearing Gi is intended to provide a training device for non-contact training so that padding such as that taught by DeSantis is not required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Reference to Martial Arts herein includes karate, kung-fu, tae kwon do, judo, jujitsu and the like, and is not intended to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The kicks and punches used to achieve efficient dominance over an opponent must during practice be directed to the most vital or vulnerable points on the human body. The Gi of the present invention has highly visible indicia such as patches or targets, which provide a visual target during practice sessions for locating these vital strike points as the opponent takes evasive and counter-attacking action. The targets aid in the non-contact practicing of accurate kicks and punches to these areas. Advantageously, in one embodiment of the invention, the Gi is reversible so that a conventionally appearing Gi may be turned inside-out to expose the targets for non-contact practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such targets may be mounted on or integrated with the fabric of the Gi, on one of its sides, by a number of different methods such as by dyeing, by sewing, by silk-screening or other printing methods, or by ironing on such separate targets as will have heat-activated adhesive on one side. Such targets may conform in both size and shape to the vulnerable area of the body and may be raised, textured or padded. In alternative embodiments the targets may include sensors to detect successful strikes and/or to detect the force of such strikes. The sensors may communicate such strike information electrically or otherwise for gathering, collation and processing by a remote digital processor, for example a remote laptop computer. Such information, once processed, may be used to monitor training or matches between combatants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The targets, then, may be situated on the Gi so as to indicate the locations of the following 12 strike points: Trapezius Muscle, Triceps Muscle, Biceps Muscle, Brachioradial Muscle, Abdomen, Groin, Medial Quadriceps Muscle, Lateral Quadriceps Muscle, Medial Calf Muscle, Lateral Calf Muscle, Kidney and Axilla. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The Martial Arts Gi of the present invention is thus a garment having highly visible patches or targets attached or formed in an outer surface, where the garment may be reversible so that the targets are on one side only, that side generally being the inside reversible surface thereof. These targets are positioned on the surface of the garment so as to lie superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points or strike zones on the body of the wearer. During practice sessions, the garment may be worn so as to expose the targets, that is, so that they are visible to an opponent. The combatants may then aim their non-contacting practice kicks and punches more accurately at these targets or strike zones so as to practice striking the most vital points of their opponent&apos;s body. By having visual target indicia for reference on the opponent during practice sessions, co-ordination and accuracy may more rapidly improve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In summary, the martial arts Gi of the present invention includes a flexible fabric garment adapted to be worn by a user, where the garment has a plurality of flexible target indicia on an outwardly exposed outer surface of the garment. The garment when so worn covers at least the torso and may cover the limbs of a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The target indicia are positioned on the garment so as to correspond to the position of vulnerable target areas on the user when wearing the garment. Vulnerable target areas means areas on the user which are vulnerable to forceful impacts such as kicks or punches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Where the garment covers the limbs of the user, the target indicia include target indicia on the limb-covering portions of the garment so as to correspond to vulnerable target areas on the limbs of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the garment is reversible. For example, the garment may comprise a jacket and a pair of pants. The target indicia may be sized and shaped to represent the size and shape of the corresponding vulnerable target areas of the user. For example, the target indicia may be fabric patches which are each generally round or obround and mounted to the garment so as to lie flush. The target indicia are preferably indicated by means for contrasting the indicia from the garment, for example by contrasting markings, color, texture, padding or appearance generally. The target indicia may include strike sensors.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As seen in the accompanying figures, the Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is manufactured for example from a sturdy heavy grade cotton fabric so as to resist rips and tears during use. The Gi may generally comprise a separate jacket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and trousers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The jacket has overlapping front panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>a which are retained in a closed position by a fabric belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The Gi of the present invention has a reversible embodiment. In this embodiment, not intended to be limiting, when practice uniform or Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is worn in its reversed position, i.e. turned inside-out as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the interior surface of the Gi is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has positioned thereon target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicating targets or strike zones. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be attached to the fabric of the interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in any one of several suitable ways, such as by sewing, adhesive, or the like, or may be formed, printed or dyed onto the fabric. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points on the body. The target indicia may be brightly coloured or otherwise adapted to contrast against Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may generally conform in both size and shape to the corresponding target area of the body, which when accurately impacted with the requisite force, will disable the opponent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The Gi may be reversed back to a conventional appearing Gi such as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by once again turning the garment inside-out. In other embodiments the Gi may not be reversible, or may have different target patterns or differently sized targets depending on which side of the reversible Gi is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The vital points of contact on the body over which, typically, strike zone targets may be superimposed are as follows: targets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located over the trapezius muscles, targets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> identify the triceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> identify the biceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> identify the brachioradial muscle, target <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> identifies the abdomen, target <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> identifies the groin, targets <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> identify the medial quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> identify the lateral quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> identify the medial calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> identify the lateral calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> identify the kidneys and targets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> identify the axilla. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A sleeve has an outer aesthetic covering lined with a sound absorbing material with the inner surfaces of the sound absorbing material being covered with a further covering. Each end of the sleeve is open and gathers about the wrists of the user when in use. The device can take the form of a container made of any desired shape such as spherical, rectangular cubic, square cubic, or any other desired configuration including two openings allowing access to the interior chamber by the hands of the user and structure to gather the periphery of each opening about the wrist of the user to seal the chamber with the hands of the user within the chamber. The device is employed by inserting a wrapped candy bar or other treat through one of the openings and into the internal chamber of the device. The hands are inserted through the respective openings and the openings are gathered in any suitable manner about the wrists to seal the enclosed chamber from emission of sound. The hands are used within the chamber to manipulate the candy bar to open the wrapper while preventing most, if not all, sound emission. Once the candy bar has been unwrapped, it may be removed along with the wrapper through one of the openings of the device and may be eaten. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. Recently, a study was conducted to determine whether opening a candy bar wrapper slowly results in a reduction in noise emission over opening a candy bar wrapper quickly. The study concluded that either technique results in emission of an equivalent amount of noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As such, it has now been scientifically determined that opening a candy bar wrapper slowly within a feeder or stadium does nothing to diminish the disturbance of that act. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There has always been a need for some device that would permit one to quietly open a candy bar wrapper within a feeder or stadium. It is with this need in mind that the present invention was developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. The present invention includes the following interrelated objects, aspects and features: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sleeve is provided having an outer aesthetic covering lined with a sound absorbing material with the inner surfaces of the sound absorbing material being covered with a further covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) Each end of the sleeve is open and includes structure to cause the opening to gather about the wrists of the user when in use. One embodiment of such gathering consists of sealing means comprising elastic installed about the periphery of each opening and tending to compress the opening so that it gathers about the wrist of the user. In an alternative embodiment, the sealing means comprises a string such as a shoestring that may be threaded through an annular chamber, extending out through one or two openings formed in the end of the sleeve with the user pulling the string to tighten the opening about the wrist of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (3) If desired, as an alternative, the inventive device can take the form of a container made of any desired shape such as spherical, rectangular cubic, square cubic, or any other desired configuration including two openings allowing access to the interior chamber by the hands of the user and some means to gather the periphery of each opening about the wrist of the user to seal the chamber with the hands of the user therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (4) In any event, the inventive device in any one of its embodiments is employed by inserting a wrapped candy bar or other treat through one of the openings and into the internal chamber of the device. The hands are inserted through the respective openings and the openings are gathered in any suitable manner about the wrists to seal the enclosed chamber from emission of sound. The hands are used within the chamber to manipulate the candy bar to open the wrapper while preventing most, if not all, sound emission. Once the candy bar has been unwrapped, it may be removed along with the wrapper through one of the openings of the device and may be eaten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As such, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the openings of the sleeve are gathered so that they tightly surround the wrists of the user when the user&apos;s hands are placed within the chamber thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method wherein such gathering is accomplished through elastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the gathering is provided through a circumferentially extending string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the chamber is made in a polygonal shape such as, for example, rectangular cubic, square cubic and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method which is made in a spherical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, aspects and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference, first, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first embodiment of the device used in the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is seen to include an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a further lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> wherein the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sleeve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes opposed openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which lead to an internal chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is gathered in a direction toward closing of the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a circumferential piece of elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> suitably sewn onto the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a piece of elastic <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is sewn about the periphery of the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method of the present invention, the sound insulative layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as fiberglass, foam or any material that resists transmission therethrough of sound waves. Put another way, the material for the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should efficiently absorb sound waves. Such materials are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a user inserts a wrapped product such as a candy bar within the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and inserts their hands into the respective openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> causing the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, respectively, to gather about the wrists of the user to create sealing means causing the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to become sealed and air tight. The user then manipulates their hands to open the candy bar wrapper and remove the piece of candy therefrom. This having been accomplished, the candy bar and its wrapper may easily be removed through one or the other of the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, whereupon the wrapper may be discarded and the candy bar may be consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an alternative construction of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in which like elements are referred to with like primed reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; and an inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; leads to a chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. Instead of the elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an elongated string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided that is threaded circumferentially through the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; via the openings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown. Such a structure is similar to the well known drawstrings used to tighten the waistband of a pair of sweatpants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Similar structure is provided for the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The operation of the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to that of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. After the hands are inserted into the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a corresponding string (not shown) with respect to the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown) are tightened to cause the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to be air tight about the wrists of the user. Thereafter, operation is the same as that of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, although after the product wrapper has been opened, the strings including the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are suitably loosened to allow the hands to be removed from the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of the present invention designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and seen to include an outer housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is made in a rectangular cubic or square cubic configuration. One face <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes two openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> therethrough corresponding to the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be provided with a tendency to gather about the wrists of the user through the use of elastic such as is disclosed with respect to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or with a drawstring such as the drawstring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or through any other suitable means. Alternatively, the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be respectively provided in opposed or adjacent panels of the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is generally spherical or elliptical and the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are adjacent to one another. Of course, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be placed on opposed portions of the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or separated from one another by any desired degree. As is the case with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may tend to gather about the wrists of the user in any suitable way such as is disclosed hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In all of the embodiments of the present invention set forth hereinabove, the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be omitted provided the sound insulative material such as that designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has the structural integrity to enclose the hands and wrists of the user without damage thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if either the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or both are to be included, they each may be made of any suitable material such as cloth or plastic or rubber. The sole purpose for the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to provide an aesthetic cover for the device and, if necessary, to provide structural integrity to the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The sole purpose for the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is to maintain the structural integrity of the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, if necessary, to preclude engagement of the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the hands of the user. For example, where the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made of fiberglass material, it would be best to avoid direct contact with that material by the hands of the user to avoid fiberglass splinters from entering the hands of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As should be evident, the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> operate in a similar manner to those of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The user inserts a wrapped product inside the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> through one of the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and thereafter inserts their hands into the openings with the openings gathering about the wrists thereof to provide a sealed chamber. The wrapper is manipulated and opened and is thereafter removed through one of the openings along with the unwrapped product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Of course, as should be understood by those skilled in the art, the wrapped product can be placed within the sound insulated chamber after one hand is inserted therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As such, an invention has been disclosed in terms of preferred embodiments thereof which fulfill each and every one of the objects of the invention as set forth hereinabove and provide new and useful embodiments of a method of using a sound insulated device for quietly opening wrapped products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Of course, various changes, modifications and alterations in the teachings of the present invention may be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the intended spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As such, it is intended that the present invention only be limited by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">V. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a side view of the present invention attached to toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen as it winds from toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and eventually connects up to filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is divided into two compartments, an upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, by divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a front-mounted upper panel access door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which allows access to upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to exchange filters as needed, and also has a front-mounted lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which allows access to lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also has front-mounted exhaust port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> embedded on it. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows access to the motor located within the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this diagram, seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be seen. Seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could include a spring-loaded electric switch which is normally open. When a person sits upon the seat, the weight of the person would compress seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a closed configuration. The electrical current then activates the fan motor, causing the motor of the present invention to engage and the present invention to operate. Alternatively, the electronic schematics of the present invention might be triggered by the light switch or the fan switch alone and not be triggered by any electronics associated with the seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the present invention installed. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen connected to two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located in the rear half of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A plurality of small ventilation ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allow air within the bowl to be sucked into the two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of the filtration system of the present invention. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be seen entering the top of filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Within upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, replaceable filter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located. In addition, divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which divides upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with that of lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which serve as air passage ports between upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Air entering filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enters via ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passes through upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, it passed through replaceable filter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, where the odor would be removed. After this, the air passes through apertures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this point, the air moves toward squirrel cage fan <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and outward through exhaust port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Squirrel cage fan <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is driven by flexible belt <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to electric motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Power cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to electric motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow a user to choose to provide power to the present invention or to not use the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, power would be supplied to the present invention only when a wall switch, such as a bathroom light switch or a bathroom fan switch, would be turned on. In these embodiments, the unit would not be activated if a user actually sat down on toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but did not turn on the light in the bathroom. However, the present invention would be activated by turning on the appropriate light or fan switch in the bathroom. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While modern technology has given us many advances and improvements in our lives, there are those advances which sometimes are a setback to what was previously used. An example of this is the common lavatory or sink drain. Years ago, the common way of holding water in a bowl with a drain was the rubber stopper. Advances in plumbing technology, metal and plastics led to the development and common use of the integral drain mechanism which used a lever to seal the drain from above the waterline. While this has generally worked, there are those instances where the integral drain commonly leaks water into the drain or leaks water on the floor through the lever attachment seal. Often replacement parts are no longer available for older drain mechanisms and the entire lavatory or sink must be replaced. Also, there are those users who may be looking for a retro lifestyle look and are unable to find it amongst current plumbing fixture offerings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which the drain stopper mechanism of lavatories, sinks, tubs and the like can be replaced and/or repaired in a simple, straightforward manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a stopper-type apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in the cylindrical drains of lavatories, kitchen sinks, utility tubs and the like is provided. The unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a round plastic plug or drain stopper <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, adapted to seat in a cylindrical drain, with a vinyl sealing ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around its perimeter and a weighted lower or bottom portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is intended for use primarily in the drains of bathroom lavatories, but can be made in varying sizes for use in the drains of kitchen sinks, utility tubs, and other similar sinks. A chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fastened at its proximate end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a chain securement means or bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted to the center <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of plastic plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to allow plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be extracted from the drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of a lavatory or sink basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without placing one&apos;s hand in the water in basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defined by waterline WL. This chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would be secured to the faucet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at its other or distal or faucet securing end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by an integral ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, operation of the prior art automatic hair washer will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> First, in an initial operation, hot water and cold water is given to the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from an external water supply and an external hot water supply via a curb stop, a strainer, and a check valve. The hot water and the cold water is mixed in the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be warm water having a temperature suitable for hair washing, and supplied to the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the motor valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The wash water stored in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sucked by the hot water supplying pump <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>through the hot water supply pipe A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>via the hot water supplying electromagnetic valves <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. After the wash water is spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>during a predetermined time, spouting of the wash water is stopped and the subsequent process, i.e., shampooing process is started. The shampoo agent pumped by the shampoo supplying pump <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is spouted from the nozzle heads <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>together with the wash water. When the shampooing process ends, the subsequent rinsing process and the process for washing with clean water follow, and then a series of washing processes ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In using the above-described prior art automatic hair washer, when wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the wash water is drained. This is because before performing the next hair washing, the time may pass and the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank may be cooled, whereby it may be impossible to use the wash water. Therefore, when large amount of wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the large amount of wash water is in vain and it is quite uneconomical. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic hair washer which does not drain wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing but uses the wash water in the next hair washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description and specific embodiments described are provided only for illustration since various additions and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art from the detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, an automatic hair washer performing hair washing by supplying wash water in a hot water storing tank to washing nozzles comprises a temperature detecting means for measuring a temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, a heater for heating the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature. Therefore, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing is not drained but used in the next hair washing after heated by the heater, thereby saving water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, the automatic hair washer of the first aspect of the present invention comprises a water amount detecting means for detecting amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature and the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is more than a predetermined amount. Therefore, when the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is small, the wash water is not heated by the heater, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a construction of an automatic hair washer according to a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the figure, the same reference numerals and characters as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> designate the same or corresponding parts. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> designates a heater for heating wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> designates a heater control unit for controlling the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the temperature or water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, operation of the automatic hair washer according to the first embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> First, in an initial operation, hot water and cold water is given to the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from an external water supply and an external hot water supply via a curb stop, a strainer, and a check valve. The hot water and the cold water is mixed in the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be warm water having a temperature suitable for hair washing and supplied to the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> until the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> monitors the temperature and water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the thermistor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the float switch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in process of hair washing. When the temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below a set temperature and the water level thereof is over the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches on the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to have the set temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature and the water level is below the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not start the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or, when the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is already working, switches off the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below the lowest water level, when hair washing is to be continued thereafter, warm water is supplied from the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to replenish the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when hair washing is to be ended, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is drained from the drainage electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereby there is no need for insulation by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in either case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the predetermined temperature, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is started by the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, whereby the temperature of the wash water is set to the predetermined temperature. Therefore, even if the large amount of the wash water remains in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the end of hair washing, the wash water is not drained but can be used in the following hair washing, thereby saving water. In addition, when the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> detects that the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature by the thermistor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that the water level thereof is below the lowest water level by the float switch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, heating of the wash water by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not performed, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to collapsible furniture, and more particularly to bedding which may be used for temporary purposes such as for overnight guests. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Temporary beds have been used for many years and come in many forms, from a simple futon or air mattress to more complex &ldquo;hide-a-bed&rdquo; style devices. Such temporary beds are most often used when guests, either expected or otherwise, stay overnight. In such cases, it is desirable that the temporary bed be quick and easy to assemble, comfortable, and collapse to a small configuration which can be easily and conveniently stored in a closet or storage cabinet. An air mattress has the advantage of deflating to a very compact size when the internal air pressure is released, and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. The air pressure in the mattress gives good support to body members and the air can redistribute within the mattress slightly in response to greater weight loads in certain areas. It can thus conform to the user&apos;s body, is lightweight, and is generally easily portable, even when inflated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, those who go camping out of trailers, etc. may wish to sleep out-of-doors, but may wish to isolate themselves from insects, snakes and other forest denizens which may roam the forest floor. For such purposes, an elevated bed, which is easily collapsible and portable, may be very useful. It also may be useful in rocky terrain, or in areas of thorns or burrs, which would otherwise contact the air mattress and possibly puncture it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the less effort involved in constructing the bed, the more desirable the typical user would consider the bed to be. People who are contemplating retiring to bed are often already in a state of fatigue or unsteadiness in which the construction of a bed from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration may seem a daunting prospect. Therefore, a bed structure which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting, would be very desirable in a variety of situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed which is elevated from contact with the ground or floor, and which is both very portable and comfortable for the user. There is also a need for a bed which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a bed that is collapsible and portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a bed which stores in a very small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> And another object of the invention is to provide a bed which uses an air mattress which is elevated up off the floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a bed which requires a minimum of human effort to construct from a collapsed configuration to an expanded one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the invention is to provide a self-expanding bed in which the self-erecting mechanism is operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Briefly, one preferred embodiment of the present invention is a collapsible bed having an air mattress and a support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area, when a portion of the frame is pulled outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second preferred embodiment is a self-expanding bed having an air mattress and an articulated support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area. The air mattress is attached to the support frame at a number of points, so that when the air mattress is inflated and expands outwardly, the support frame also expands outwardly. An electric air pump may also be included, which may be activated by a remote control, so that the bed is self-expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that it uses an external frame and independent air mattress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the invention is that the air mattress can be replaced if damaged, without replacing the whole bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> And another advantage of the invention is that the frame is constructed with permanently joined members connected with pivot joints so that the frame collapses and expands as a unit, and requires very little construction or hunting for lost pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of the invention is that it contains an air-pump which can be activated by a remote control to cause the pump to fill the mattress. The force of the air in the mattress as it expands causes the frame structure to expand and move from its collapsed to its expanded configuration, with minimal, or no manual effort by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear to those skilled in the art in view of the description of the best presently known mode of carrying out the invention and the industrial applicability of the preferred embodiment as described herein and as illustrated in the several figures of the drawings.</paragraph>

The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a number of cells <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and at least one inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through which air is introduced to inflate the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not completely enclose the entire air mattress, but may enclose only a portion or portions such as the ends or sides of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined at the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the comers causes movement in all the other comers, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be spoken of as &ldquo;expanding outwardly from a central area&rdquo;, although it is to be understood that one of the feet may actually remain in fixed position, while the remainder of the feet move outward. In other words, the central reference area from which the feet move, may itself move laterally. One example of this occurs when the collapsed support frame is placed in the corner of a room, where, say, the left rear foot of the frame is in the left rear corner of the room, and thus is constrained from movement in a further leftward or rearward direction. When the frame expands, all the other, non-constrained feet will expand outwardly from a central area to the right, or forward, or both, even as the central area itself will move to the right and forward, relative to the immobile left rear foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that all the lines of direction of the movement of the feet are not expected to intersect at a precise point. The central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is thus a relatively small region from which the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> move outwardly, but there should be no inference that all feet must move in a specific lines, such as radially from a single specific center point. To one skilled in the art, it will be apparent that if such precise directionality were attempted, manufacturing errors would inevitably introduce variations. Thus, the expansion is considered to move outwardly from a central area or region, and should not be construed to imply any particular lines of direction, other than generally outward from this central area. The direction arrows and central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> below, are therefore not provided to show specific lines of movement which must be followed, but merely a general direction of movement towards, or away from, a general central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The articulated frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also optionally includes support webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which may have hooks (not shown) which anchor the support webbing to the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may also have attachment points (not shown) for securing the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show closer views of the assembled air bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which several of the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are selected for detail views in detail circles A-F. The pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are made to receive <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connections and thus will be called four-pivot connectors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These are preferably reversible, so that the same four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be used as a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and as an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus making for uniformity, and ease of manufacturing. The frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> too are preferably interchangeable and of uniform length, with the exception of the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which are positioned in each of the four comers. These are composed of two or more corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may slide within each other in order to extend or contract in length. This is desirable because when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in collapsed position, the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be of greater length than when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is expanded. In the expanded position therefore, one of the corner members will preferably slide within the other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, thus the assembly sequence allows for the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be placed upright, expanded, the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closed, and the bed is ready to receive bed clothes, or be otherwise used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A useful variation on this invention is an air-bed with a self-expanding support structure. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The structure and elements are much the same, and when elements correspond to those used previously, the same element numbers will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The air-bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, either directly, or preferably through a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment may be permanent or removable, by such conventional means as buttons, snaps, Velcro&reg;, etc., but it is important that the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as it expands, is attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged to move with the expansion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. There is a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described previously, which may also be the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which protects the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from damage at points where it is rubbed against the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while inflating or deflating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to an inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically operated, and can be powered either by wall current or by batteries. If batteries are used, they may be included in a battery pack (not shown). The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which can be operated by a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means from a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means is preferably cordless, such as radio or infra-red diode laser beam, etc. The remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has an on-off button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which activates and deactivates the electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is by no means a necessity, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for back-up operation if the remote <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is misplaced or the remote&apos;s batteries are low, or if the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed not to be operated by remote control at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the direction arrows <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or it may be removable in order to allow access to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by either a hand pump or by mouth in case electrical power is unavailable for the electrical pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or if it breaks down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has been attached to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a detail view of the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been removed. Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into which the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been seated. This recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to fit smoothly without extending far beyond the perimeter of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus protecting it from being bumped or knocked away from its position at the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be maintained in position after the inflation is complete. Of course, the use of a recess area is optional and should not be considered as a limitation. Also, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made to be routinely removed after operation. In this case a self-sealing valve (not shown) is provided for the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is also shown, which is preferably included even when the pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is expected to be operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature is a secondary inflation port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be used for attachment of a manual air pump or for inflation by lung power. This may be a conventional air valve as generally used in air mattresses. It may also be used as a venting port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for allowing air pressure out of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is to be maintained in position, perhaps permanently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention uses an air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is removable. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably fitting with a friction lock (not visible) similar to those used to attach lens to cameras, and which forms an airtight seal between the two parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also preferably contains a pressure sensor or self-regulator (not visible) which detects or acts when the air pressure in the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has reached a predetermined level, and which then shuts off the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is also not a required feature and should not be construed as a limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the electrical air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be operated from batteries, perhaps from a battery pack. The bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is thus usable in the outdoors or in a cabin which is not equipped with power lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> present an easy and attractive way of providing bedding for overnight guests or visitors. The articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and at pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at multiple points, either directly, or by being at least partially enclosed by a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is, in turn, attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and inflated, either by the user&apos;s lung power or by activation of an electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the preferred air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, it is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses laterally on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will find much application in user&apos;s homes, in commercial travel lodges, such as hotels, etc. where an extra bed may be needed, and may also find use in business offices to replace the occasional folding cot presently used by workaholics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For the above, and other, reasons, it is expected that the air bed with elevated and self-expanding support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention will have widespread industrial applicability. Therefore, it is expected that the commercial utility of the present invention will be extensive and long lasting. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to bed siderails, and, more particularly, to bed siderails with flexible portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds often have siderails to reduce the likelihood that convalescing patients will inadvertently fall out of their beds. The siderails are usually constructed from metal or a similarly rigid material such as a stiff plastic or polymer, and may be raised and lowered vertically to accommodate a patient moving into and out of the hospital bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds also often have a head section of the bed that may be pivoted upwardly about a transverse pivot axis to allow the patient to move to a sitting position. It is desirable to simultaneously pivot the siderails adjacent to the head section of the bed upwardly with the head section of the bed. To accommodate raising the siderails in this manner, the siderails are typically divided into two sections, a head section and a body section. The head section and body section siderails must be spaced apart at the transverse pivot axis to allow the head section siderail to pivot without impinging the stationary body section siderail. Therefore, a gap is created between the head section siderail and the body section siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a bed siderail of unitary construction which eliminates the gap between conventional siderails. The bed siderail of the present invention includes a flexible portion to allow a portion of the siderail adjacent the head section of the bed to pivot upwardly with the head section of the bed, while body section of the siderail remains substantially stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed having a frame and a head deck section coupled to the frame. The head deck section is movable relative to the frame from a generally horizontal position to an elevated position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the head deck section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its elevated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, the flexible member bends in a second direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its generally horizontal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, a lifting mechanism is coupled to the frame and to the second end portion of the flexible member. The lifting mechanism is configured to raise and lower the flexible member relative to the frame. A locking mechanism is illustratively coupled to the lifting mechanism and a release handle coupled to the locking mechanism. Actuation of the release handle releases the locking mechanism and permits movement of the lifting mechanism and the flexible member relative to the frame. The illustrated embodiment also includes an extendible section located along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member and capable of extending and retracting along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed including a patient support surface having opposite first and second sides, a head end, and a foot end spaced apart from the head end to define a length dimension of the patient support surface therebetween. The siderail includes first and second elongated flexible members coupled to the bed and extending along the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second flexible members illustratively extend for at least fifty percent of the length dimension of the patient support surface. The siderail also includes first and second lifting mechanisms coupled to the bed adjacent the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second lifting mechanisms also are coupled to the first and second flexible members, respectively, to raise and lower the first and second flexible members relative to the patient support surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another illustrated embodiment of the invention includes a siderail for a bed having a frame and an elevating section coupled to the frame, the elevating section having a raised position and a lowered position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the elevating section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the elevating section is in its raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another illustrative embodiment of the invention includes a siderail covering for a bed siderail having flexible portions and extendible portions. The siderail covering includes a material configured to flex along the flexible portion of the bed siderail and compress along the extendible portion of the bed siderail. The material including a plurality of compressible regions, and defines an central aperture configured to receive the bed siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also according to the invention, the siderail covering material further defines a seam extending from the outer surface of the siderail cover to the central aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Additional features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiment exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> hospital bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a bed frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supported by a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Footboard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and headboard <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are attached to bed frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A first siderail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a second siderail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are located on each side of the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to restrain movement of a patient past opposite side edges of a first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to head deck section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to bed frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. First siderail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a flexible section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an extendible section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Likewise, second siderail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a flexible section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an extendible section <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck is pivoted upwardly relative to frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and body section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the deck. Flexible sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> articulate upwardly with head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck while the extendible sections <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remain in a horizontal orientation substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the hospital bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Due to the curvature of flexible sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the length of extendible sections <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> varies as head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck is raised or lowered. Extendible sections <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> expand and contract in length in the direction of the double-headed arrow <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> First and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be raised and lowered vertically through operation of lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> caregiver raises first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by actuating a release mechanism on a handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and pulling upwardly in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then placed in a locked position so that the first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend vertically above the plane of the patient support surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Due to the curvature of flexible sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the length of extendible sections <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> varies as lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is raised or lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> First and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also be raised and lowered vertically through operation of lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck is in the elevated position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> caregiver raises first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by actuating the release mechanism on the handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and pulling upwardly in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then placed in a locked position and first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are positioned as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The flexible sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are illustratively formed by a plurality of interconnected links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of proximately spaced inner link plates <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, each inner link plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> having a pin <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extending from an outer surface <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> of the inner link plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The pins <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extend outwardly perpendicularly from the longitudinal axis of the link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Proximately spaced from each inner link plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is a receiver space <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> defined by spaced apart blocks <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The other end of the link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of outer link plates <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Plates <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are each formed to include an aperture <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Distal prongs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are defined by a first wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which extends substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a second wall <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> extending at a varying angle &agr; measured vertically from the longitudinal axis of link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> semi-flexible rod <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> extends through a central bore <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> formed in the link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the entire length of the siderail. The semi-flexible rod <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> slides freely through bore <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Inner link plates <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are pivotally coupled to outer link plates <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of an adjacent link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by inserting pins <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Distal prongs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extend into receivers <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of an adjacent link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and limit the range of motion of the connected links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provided by the pivotal coupling of inner link plates <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and outer link plates <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> First wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> limits rotation in a first direction by abutting an inner surface <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> of block <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Because first wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of link <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the articulation of a plurality of interconnected links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is limited such that the plurality of interconnected links <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may not extend substantially below the horizontal plane h-h&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a spacing tolerance d is provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. First and second links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are positioned parallel to horizontal plane h-h&prime;. Spacing tolerance d is selected such that rotation in a first direction as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> may extend below the horizontal plane h-h&prime; by an angle &bgr;. The spacing tolerances is varied to allow for more abrupt downward curvature of first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the pivotal connections to head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck. Of course, first wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may also extend at an angle similar to second wall <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> rather than extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Second wall <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> limits rotation of the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a second direction by abutting an inner surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of block <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Angle &agr; varies depending upon the location of link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the siderail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to permit curvature of interconnected links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> above horizontal plane k-k&prime;. A larger angle &agr; results is in a larger angle of curvature &thgr; above plane k-k&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Angle a is selected to allow for more abrupt upward curvature of first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the pivotal connections to head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art in considering the above descriptions of the illustrative embodiment disclosed, other embodiments of links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may comprise a pivotal joint member which provides rotation relative to planes h-h&prime; and k-k&prime; while restricting rotation within those planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> covers links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is illustratively made from a soft, compressible material that freely flexes along the articulation path of the plurality of links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Compression teeth <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> are cut into the top of siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to provide consistent bending of siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> without buckling. A series of interlaced bellow apertures comprising v-shaped cuts <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> form compressible regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> also accommodate flexure and compression of the siderail material. The siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is illustratively covered by a flexible, waterproof fabric shell, such as nylon or similar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A mating surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is provided on the link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to engage a corresponding surface on the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and thereby prevent the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> from sliding along or rotating around the plurality of links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the mating surface is a Velcro material. Alternatively, a mating extension or fin <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enters a slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> formed in the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Mating extensions may also extend horizontally from link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It is understood that other suitable fasteners such as, for example, snaps, ties, or adhesives may be used to secure the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for the first and second siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also differ in cross-sectional geometry, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. First siderail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has an interior surface <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> adjacent the patient support surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the hospital bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An exterior curved surface <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> extends downward, forming exterior planar surface <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. Links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are housed within cavity <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Seam <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is provided to readily remove and attach the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Couplings <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> secure the seam <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> when the siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is attached to links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Couplings <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> are realized by any number of couplings known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including snap attachments, Velcro attachments, or a zipper extending the length of the seam <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Second siderail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has siderail material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> having an exterior planar surface <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and an interior planar surface <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Raising or lowering the scissors lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> causes the first, second and third pairs of scissors links <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to rotate about pins <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, respectively, and cooperatively slide through bearing tracks <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Bearing members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may either be wheeled members or fixed nylon bearing surfaces engaging bearing tracks <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The scissors lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be locked at varying elevations. One illustrative locking mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. A rod <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is rotatably attached to bearing member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at one end and is inserted into receiving member <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> at the other end. Receiving member <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to second cylinder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by coupling <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. A mechanical detent lock <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> engages rod <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and prevents the rod <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> from sliding in receiving member <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, prevents movement of first and second pairs of scissors links <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and also prevents bearing members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from sliding in bearing track <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Lock <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is operatively associated with a release mechanism on handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that the lock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> releases the rod <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> when the release mechanism is actuated. Accordingly, the scissors lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is illustratively vertically adjustable when the release mechanism on the handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is actuated and is in a locked position when release mechanism on the handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is not actuated. Other locking mechanisms can be substituted for the detent lock <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> described above, such as Mechlok&reg; brand clutch locking mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not limited to a scissors-type apparatus. Lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can comprise any vertical lifting apparatus which provides horizontal movement of first and second rods <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Similarly, rather than first and second rods <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> being slidably coupled to first and second cylinders <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, first and second rods <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and first and second cylinders <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are illustratively self-contained telescoping devices known in the art in another embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, first and second siderail anchors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may alternatively be coupled to an elevating section rather than the head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This elevating section is illustratively configured to raise and lower concurrently with the head section. Thus, rather than having siderails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> coupled to the head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the siderail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are coupled to the elevating section. An elevating section includes a device that elevates vertically and is coupled to the bed frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and near the top of head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, proximate to headboard <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the siderail anchors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> move vertically as the head section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is raised and lowered.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mattress or cushion structures designed to improve pressure distribution while reducing the overall thickness of the mattress or cushion. The mattress or cushion structures of the present invention illustratively include a foam base on which one or more indented fiber layers or other three dimensional engineered material are placed. The base and the three dimensional engineered material layers are illustratively encased in a cover to provide a mattress or cushion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While the use of foam in mattresses and cushions is known and the use of three dimensional engineered material is known, the present invention relates to a unique combination of a foam base and three dimensional engineered material layers placed on the foam base. The present invention also contemplates that, in addition to the foam base, an air cushion layer may be used with the foam and the indented fiber layers to further enhance the pressure distribution capabilities of the mattress or cushion. In some embodiments, the base may be primarily, if not solely, an air cushion which is enhanced by at least one three dimensional engineered material layer. In other embodiments, water filled bladders, springs, or zones filled with beads, gel or other such material may be used in the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5, 731,062 and 5,454,142 disclosing the three dimensional fiber networks made from textile fabrics that have projections and optional depressions which are compressible and return to their original shape after being depressed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,731,062 and 5,454,142 are owned by Hoechst Celanese Corporation, Somerville, N.J. Such material is a synthetic thermoplastic fiber network in flexible sheets having projections and/or indentations for use as cushions and/or impact-absorbing components. The descriptions of such patents are incorporated herein by reference to establish the nature of one example of three dimensional engineered material or indented fiber layer disclosed herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the present invention contemplates use of such layers whether or not they are supplied by Hoechst Celanese Corporation and whether or not they are similar to the SPACENET&reg; product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is understood that other types of materials similar to the SPACENET&reg; material may be used. For example, the material may be any type of three dimensional engineered material having a spring rate in both the X and Y axes. Preferably such material is open and breathable to provide air passage through the layer. For instance, Model No. 5875, 5886, 5898, and 5882 materials from M&uuml;ller Textile, a molded thermoplastic spacer matrix material available from Akzo Nobel, or other suitable material may be used. Therefore, the term &ldquo;three dimensional engineered material&rdquo; is meant to include any of these types of materials used in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The concept is to use three dimensional fiber layer networks made from textile fibers that have projections and optional depressions or other structures which are compressible and which return to their original shapes after being compressed or the equivalents of such layers. The SPACENET&reg; fiber networks are typically made by thermo-mechanical deformation of textile fabrics that are in turn made from thermoplastic fibers. In accordance with the present invention other types of layers with individual spring or spring-like protrusions may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has been found that two or more such layers, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;indented fiber layers&rdquo; for convenience will assist in the pressure distribution when incorporated into an assembly comprising a well designed support base which may comprise foam or some combination of foam and air. The SPACENET&reg; layers are examples of such &ldquo;indented fiber layers.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of a seat cushion, it has been found that improved pressure distribution is provided when the seat cushion is designed to form fit the buttocks of the person sitting on the cushion. When such seat cushions are used by patients who have experienced skin tissue breakdown on their buttocks, the improved pressure distribution will permit the patients to sit up in chairs for greater periods of time for the therapeutic value that accomplishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of the present invention is therefore configured to support at least a portion of a body thereon. The apparatus includes a cover having an interior region, a base located within the interior region, and a three dimensional engineered material located within the interior region above the base. The three dimensional engineered material and the base cooperate to provide support for the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additional features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiments exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the use of hydrophobic bleaching systems to prepare textiles for finishing and, more particularly, to the use of activated peroxide bleaching via hydrophobic activators or hydrophobic peracids to prepare woven or knitted fabrics, fibers or yarns for application of durable press as well as the textiles produced therefrom. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the textile processing of natural fibers, yarns and fabrics, a pretreatment or preparation step is typically required to properly prepare the natural materials for further use and in particular for the dyeing and/or finishing stages typically required for commercial goods. These textile treatment steps remove impurities and color bodies, either naturally existing or those added by the spinning and weaving steps to the fibers and/or fabrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A common pretreatment step for preparing textiles for finishing involves a bleaching step to destroy naturally occurring color bodies and is necessary for commercially acceptable consumer fabrics. Traditional textile bleaching of natural fibers has involved the use of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has gained its wide acceptance due to its flexibility of use being capable in both hot and rapid or cold and long dwell bleaching processes and due to its environmental friendliness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While hydrogen peroxide has gained wide spread acceptance in the textile industry, it is not a particularly effective bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide, as commercially supplied, is an extremely stable compound and as a result has only a slight bleaching effect on natural fibers. To overcome its weak activity, extremely high temperatures and/or extremely long bleaching times are required in commercial processes in addition to activation of the peroxide. That is, temperatures in excess of 95&deg; C. are typically required. In addition, activation of the peroxide via the use of alkali, sulfuric acid, uv irradiation, hypochlorite or organic activators is also necessary with alkali being the most preferred. Not only do these drawbacks result in excessive cost associated with commercial textile peroxide bleaching, but the high temperatures and/or long contact times result in significant fiber damage and strength reduction of the resultant yarns and fabrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These drawbacks, in particular, fiber damage and fabric strength reduction, when combined with a durable press application are exacerbated. A number of processes are known for treating textiles to make them wrinkle-free or provide them with durable press benefits including resin or polymer treatments as well as formaldehyde crosslinking. Conventional formaldehyde durable press treatment involves saturating the textile with an aqueous solution of formaldehyde and acid catalyst followed by heat curing at high temperature to crosslink the formaldehyde to the textile. However, the combination of curing at high temperature and an acid catalyst results in an unacceptably high loss in fiber strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the combination of conventional peroxide bleaching technology with conventional durable press technology will result in unsatisfactory textile properties. Thus, the need remains for a simple, reproducible, effective and low cost process for the preparation and durable press finishing of textiles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This need is met by the present invention wherein a method for the preparation and application of durable press to textiles is provided. Textile substrates produced from the method are also provided. The method involves the treatment of textiles using activated peroxygen bleaching via hydrophobic bleaching agents followed by application of a durable press finish. The bleaching aspect of the present invention involves the use of hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleaching agent such as an activator or a hydrophobic peracid while the durable press step involves the application of a durable press via cross-linking technology such as resins or formaldehyde. In the preferred durable press treatment of the present invention, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, catalyst and silicone elastomer forming material is employed to saturate the textile followed by curing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The use of a hydrophobic bleach species provides superior fabric strength and fiber damage benefits, i.e. strength retention to fibers, yarns and fabrics, in addition to significant cost reduction in the operation of the bleaching step through the use of significantly lower bleaching temperatures than conventional peroxide bleaching and much shorter processing times, particularly in batch processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the bleaching step of the present invention, the hydrophobic bleach species of the present invention provide better absorbency on the fabrics and yarns and better &ldquo;wetting&rdquo; of the surface of the fibers than conventional peroxide bleaching techniques or hydrophilic activators. Hydrophobic bleach activators form the active bleaching species, peracid, on the surface of the fabric allowing a longer time on the surface of the fabric. Hydrophilic activators, meanwhile, form peracid in solution and must then undergo a fabric solution interaction which is less efficient. As a result, the hydrophobic activators of the present invention provide superior bleaching and whiteness while minimizing fiber damage and fabric strength reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the preferred durable press step of the present invention, the unique presence of the silicone elastomer in the durable press finish provide improved fiber strength benefits versus conventional durable press methods. Thus, the combination of the hydrophobic bleaching and the durable press of the present invention, lead to a textile with superior fiber strength properties in comparison to like textiles treated via conventional technology. The textiles provided via the present method have superior whiteness in addition to strength retention as well as superior wettability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a method for the treatment of non-finished textile components is provided. The method comprises the steps of providing a non-finished textile component such as a fiber, yarn or fabric, saturating the textile component with an aqueous bleaching solution comprising hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleaching agent such as an activator or a pre-formed hydrophobic peracid, and allowing the bleaching solution to remain in contact with the textile component for a period of time sufficient to bleach the textile component followed by finishing the textile component with the application of durable press. The preferred durable press application step includes treating the textile with an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, a catalyst capable of catalyzing a cross linking reaction with the textile and an effective amount of a silicone elastomer forming material and curing the treated textile to form durable press in the textile component. Alternatively preferred in the present invention is a durable press application comprising treating the textile with a solution of an alkylene urea and a catalyst capable of crosslinking the urea on the textile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the bleaching solution comprises hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleach activator which is selected from the group consisting of: </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present invention, a superior textile treatment process for fibers, yarns and fabrics, both knitted and woven, and superior textile substrates is provided. The treatment process involves a two step method wherein the first step is a the preparation of a non-finished textile component such as a fiber, yarn or fabric followed by the second step of providing a durable press/wrinkle free finish to the textile. Present commercial textile preparation and finishing methods, and, in particular, textile bleaching and durable press/wrinkle free finishing methods, remain unsatisfactory due to the fiber and fabric damage of the treated textiles, high costs associated with the high temperatures necessary to drive bleaching, and the high costs due to extra equipment necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a cost effective and superior performing alternative to conventional processing. The present invention involves the use of a hydrophobic bleaching agent such as an activator and hydrogen peroxide or a pre-formed peracid in conjunction with peroxide for the bleaching of non-finished textile components followed by the application of durable press and in particular the application of formaldehyde based durable press employing a silicone elastomer in the finish. These hydrophobic bleaching species provide superior results in the context of textile whiteness and in fabric strength retention. While conventional textile bleaching processes require high temperatures of more than 95&deg; C. to achieve satisfactory whiteness values of more than 70 on the CIE whiteness index, the result is a degradation of the strength of the fabrics of 15% and more from the original fabric strength, the method of the present invention provides satisfactory whiteness values of more than 70 on the CIE whiteness index while delivering superior fiber strength retention by providing a fabric strength reduction of less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 3% from of the original fabric strength following the bleaching step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention also provides for superior fiber protection as opposed to conventional bleachings processes. Conventional textile bleaching leads to excessive fiber damage as measured by an increase in chemical degradation of more than 50% in typical applications. The method of the present invention, on the other hand, provides for chemical degradation in treated fibers of no more than 25%, preferably no more than 15% and even more preferably of no more than 10% whereby an increase in chemical degradation represents an increase in fiber damage. Accordingly, the use of the method of the present invention results in a significant reduction in fiber damage as opposed to conventional bleaching technology of peroxide at more than 95&deg; which produces significantly higher fluidity increases. These unique achievements are accomplished due to the lower bleaching temperatures and surface activity possible through the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, the method of the present invention provides a significant cost advantage through the use of lower bleaching temperatures. In particular, the cost savings in both energy and time in batch type processing via the present invention are significant. Conventional batch processing involves the immersion of the non-finished fabrics in a bleaching solution and heating of the bleaching solution to the effective temperature of more than 95&deg; C. The heating of the fabric and solution to such high temperatures involves a significant investment of both money and time for heating such large quantities. However, due to the lower processing temperatures possible via the present invention, such as from about 50 to about 70&deg; C., the present invention requires significantly less energy and time investment for heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bleaching preparation step of the present invention involves the use of a bleaching solution of hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleach activator or a pre-formed hydrophobic peracid. The hydrogen peroxide or pre-formed peracid is present in the bleaching solution of the present invention at levels of from about 1 to about 20 g/L, more preferably from about 1 to about 10 g/L and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 5 g/L. The hydrophobic activator is then employed at molar ratios of activator or peracid to peroxide of from about 1:1 to about 1:50, more preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:30 and even more preferably from about 1:5 to about 1:20. Meanwhile, the ratio of bleaching solution or liquor to the amount of fabric is from about 5:1 to 100:1, more preferably from about 5:1 to about 40:1 and most preferably from about 8:1 to about 20:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Particularly useful and preferred is the combination of hydrogen peroxide and hydrophobic bleach activators, and in particular the alkanoyloxy class of bleach activators having the general formula:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> wherein R is an alkyl chain having from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 8 to about 11 carbon atoms and L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleaching activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. It should also form a stable entity so that the rate of the back reaction is negligible. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the perhydroxide anion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum time frame (e.g., a wash cycle).

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention involves in the first or bleaching step providing a non-finished textile component into the bleaching solution as described. The textile component may comprise fibers, yarns and fabrics including wovens, nonwovens and knits. By non-finished, it is intended that the textile component be a material that has not been dyed, printed, or otherwise provided a finishing step such as durable press coatings. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the textile component of the present invention are those that have not been passed through a garment or other manufacturing process involving cutting and sewing of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the process conditions to be used for bleaching in the present invention may be selected so as to match a particular equipment or a particular type of process which it is desirable to use. For example, while the textile components preferably remain in contact with the treatment solution at a temperature of from about 20 to about 80&deg; C., preferably from about 50&deg; C. to about 80&deg; C. and for a period of time suitable for treating the textile component which is at least about 15 minutes more preferably from about 30 minutes to about 180 minutes, preferably from about 30 to about 120 minutes and most preferably from about 30 to about 90 minutes. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the reaction conditions such as time and temperature will vary depending upon the equipment employed and the fabrics treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The present process may be employed with most any natural material including cellulosics such as cotton, linen and regenerated cellulosics such as rayon and lyocell. Both 100% natural fibers, yarns and fabrics may be employed or blends with synthetic materials may be employed as well. For the purposes of the present invention, natural fibers may include cellulosics as described herein, wool both pure and blends, silks, sisal, flax and jute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention may include the further preparation steps of singeing, de-sizing, scouring, and mercerization in conjunction with the bleaching step. These steps may be performed in various combinations and orders and one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that varying combinations are possible. The de-sizing step of the present invention involves the removal of sizing agents such as starch and polyvinyl alcohol added to fibers during weaving of yarns. The de-sizing step involves the use of an aqueous solution of amylase enzymes and typically wetting agents and salts and soaking or contacting the fabrics with the enzymatic solution of a time sufficient to remove the sizing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The scouring step of the present invention involves the removal of natural or synthetic impurities from the textiles such as waxes and oils. The scouring step involves the use of an aqueous alkaline bath, typically sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures. Optional ingredients in the alkaline bath include wetting agents and chelating agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The mercerization step of the present invention involves the application of high concentrations of alkali such as sodium hydroxide in conjunction with stretching and pulling of the textiles to restore fiber strength and improve luster while singeing involves passing the textiles over an open flame to remove loose fibers or strands. De-sizing, scouring, mercerization and singeing are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and will be well recognized and within the level of skill of the artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Of course the process of the present invention includes in the preferred applications a washing step or series of washing steps following the method of the present invention. Washing of treated textiles is well known and within the level of skill of the artisan. Washing stages will be typically present after each of the de-sizing, scouring and mercerization step when present as well as after the bleaching step of the present invention. In addition, the bleaching and de-sizing scouring or mercerization steps when present may in preferred embodiments include a wet-out or pre-wetting step to ensure even or uniform wettness in the textile component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention provides superior wettability to textile components treated via the method. Wettability of the textiles is important to any dyeing and finishing of the textiles. Wettability leads to superior penetration of the textile by the dye or finish agents and a superior dye and/or finishing result. Accordingly, the wettability of the textile is an indication of how effective the treatment process has been. Higher wettability means a more effective and superior treatment process, i.e. a shorter period of time for wetting. Conventional textile peroxygen bleaching has provided acceptable wetting profiles only at temperature in excess of 95&deg; C. while lower temperature bleaching (70&deg; C.) results in wettability profiles more than about 40%. However, the process of the present invention provides fabrics that have a increase in the wettability index of less than about 10% preferably less than about 5% where the wettability index is defined as:

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For purposes of the present invention, fiber damage based on fluidity is measured via AATCC test method 82-1996 involving the dispersion of the fibers in cupriethylene diamine (CP). A representative sample of fibers of about 1.5 mm is cut and dissolved in CP as defined by the equation CP&equals;120&times;sample weight&times;0.98 in a specimen bottle with several glass balls, placed under nitrogen and dissolved by shaking for approximately 2 hours. Additional CP is added as defined by the equation CP&equals;80&times;sample weight&times;0.98 and additional shaking under nitrogen for three hours. The solution is placed under constant stirring to prevent separation of the dispersion. The solution is then measured in a calibrated Oswald Canon Fenske viscometer in a constant temperature bath of 25&deg; C. to determine the efflux time. Fluidity is then calculated from the formula F&equals;100/ctd, where c&equals;viscometer constant, t&equals;efflux time and d&equals;density of the solution 1.052. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> wherein the groups R and R&prime; may be the same or different and includes, for example, lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenyl or any of these groups substituted by hydroxy groups, fluoride atoms, or amino groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The materials used to provide the silicone elastomer in the finish in the present invention may be made by conventional means and are readily available from a variety of sources include GE Silicones, Sedgefield Specialties and other chemical suppliers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The elastomers in the finish are typically high molecular weight materials generally formed of dimethyl silicone monomers formed in a linear chain. The typically available in an un-reacted form with or without a catalyst to facilitate crosslinking. The crosslinked elastomer on the textile improves the durability of the textile by producing large molecules on the textile. The silicone elastomer of the present invention provides superior strength properties to the finished textile as opposed to conventional silicone oil technology which do not provide tensile strength benefits. Optionally a reactive silicone may be employed where reactive groups capable of reacting with the substrate are incorporated into the dimethly silicone polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The aqueous system of formaldehyde, an acid catalyst, material capable of providing a silicone elastomer in the finish and optionally a wetting agent is provided on the textile, preferably to ensure a moisture content of more than 20% by weight on fabric. Conventional application technology involves the use of a padding technique which comprising running the fabric through the aqueous solution which is then passed through squeezing rollers to provide a wet pick up of about 66%. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the concentration of reactants in the aqueous solution may be adjusted to provide the desired amount of reactants on the weight of fabric (OWF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Following treatment of the textiles, the formaldehyde of the preferred finish must be cured. Preferred is a high temperature heat curing via which the treated textile is passed through a curing chamber operating at a temperature of from about 250&deg; F. to about 350&deg; F. The process of the present invention may be operated continuously on commercial scale speeds of from about 1 to about 200 yards per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The concentration of ingredients in the aqueous solution of course may be varied depending upon the textile treated. For instance, textile containing rayon fibers will require higher levels of formaldehyde than textiles containing cotton fibers who in turn require more than textiles blended with synthetic fibers such as polyester, acrylic, polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride. The levels of formaldehyde in the aqueous solution will range from about 0.5% to about 20% on weight of fabric while the levels of catalyst will range from about 0.1% to about 5% on weight of fabric and silicone elastomer providing material will range from about 0.1% to about 5% as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The catalyst employed in the present invention includes those conventionally known for formaldehyde finishing such as fluorosilicic acid, magnesium chloride spiked with citric acid or a similar catalyst containing aluminum or magnesium chloride. In addition, an optional nonionic wetting agent to thoroughly wet the fibers in the treated textiles may be employed in the method of the present invention in levels of around 0.1% on weight of fabric. Conventional and well-known wetting agents may be employed such as for example the alkyl aryl polyether alcohol such as Triton X-100. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that during the crosslinking reaction at the curing stage, moisture is given up from the fabric as the crosslinking occurs, resulting in a decrease in the moisture content of the fabric. In fabrics having a moisture content of less than 20%, the effectiveness of the treatment is reduced. Thus, it is preferred in the present invention to employ high moisture levels greater than 20%, more preferably greater than 30% to optimize the treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For centuries, fabric articles have been washed using water-based processes. In the last century, this home chore was greatly simplified by the development of the automatic washing machine. However, while greatly simplifying the home laundry process, even the home laundry process using the automatic washing machine still requires a significant amount of presorting fabric articles by color and textiles. Typically whites are washed separately from colored fabrics, and brightly colored fabric articles (e.g., dark reds and blues) from less highly colored articles. Further sorting and handling is required when the fabric articles to be laundered include &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo; articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More recently, water conservation efforts and environmental concerns have driven laundry machine manufacturers and laundry detergent manufacturers to reduce the amount of water required in the home laundry process. However, such efforts have focused on reducing water consumption by the wash medium rather than changing the wash medium from a primarily water based process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In parallel, concerns have arisen around the use of &ldquo;Perc&rdquo; (short for perchloroethylene) as the wash medium for the commercial dry cleaning process. These concerns have lead to the development of a significant number of proposed alternatives the Perc-based processes, but to date all other alternatives are still not widely used. Examples include hydrocarbons and liquid carbon dioxide. A more recently proposed option as a replacement for Perc in the commercial dry cleaning field involves the use of siloxanes as the cleaning solution for &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo; fabric articles (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,007, Aug. 24, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,617 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,618, both Mar. 28, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,789, May 2, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,059,845, May 9, 2000; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,135, May 16, 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered by the present invention that further simplification of the automatic home laundry process and elimination of the reliance on a solely water based home laundry process are possible by using a siloxane based wash medium for the home laundry process. This process allows not only the home cleaning of a consumer&apos;s &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo; fabric articles, but also those &ldquo;machine wash&rdquo; articles conventionally washed at home in a water wash medium. Further while the consumer may still opt to wash such articles separately, the present invention process allows the consumer the freedom to significantly simplify the home laundry process by washing mixed loads of &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine wash&rdquo; articles, thereby greatly reducing the presorting effort. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;fabric article&rdquo;, as used herein, means any article that is customarily cleaned in a conventional laundry process or in a dry cleaning process. The term encompasses articles of clothing, linen and drapery, clothing accessories, and floor coverings. The term also encompasses other items made in whole or in part of fabric, such as tote bags, furniture covers, tarpaulins and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;machine washable fabric articles&rdquo;, as used herein, means those fabric articles readily identified by the fabric industry and consumers as safe for laundering by a conventional aqueous automatic home laundry process. Consumers are frequently helped in this identification of fabric articles by manufacturer&apos;s tags indentifying the fabric article as &ldquo;machine washable&rdquo; or some similar description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;dry clean only fabric articles&rdquo;, as used herein, means those fabric articles readily identified by the fabric industry and consumers as unsafe for laundering by a conventional aqueous automatic home laundry process, and instead requiring special handling with a conventional non-aqueous solvent such as Perc. Again, consumers are frequently helped in this identification of fabric articles by manufacturer&apos;s tags indentifying the fabric article as &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo; or some similar description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;automatic home laundry process&rdquo;, as used herein, means the laundry process as practiced by the consumer using an automatic washing machine, preferably located within the consumer&apos;s residence (herein referred to as the process being conducted &ldquo;in the home&rdquo;), but also including public laundromats whereby the consumer follows essentially the same laundry process as though the automatic washing machine were present in the home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;wash medium&rdquo;, as used herein, means the liquid &lsqb;including but not limited to, fluid(s) and/or solution(s) and/or solvent(s) and/or emulsion(s)&rsqb; which is used to wet the fabric articles in the wash load during the automatic home laundry process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;dry weight of a fabric article&rdquo; as used herein means the weight of a fabric article that has no intentionally added fluid weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;absorption capacity of a fabric article&rdquo; as used herein means the maximum quantity of fluid that can be taken in and retained by a fabric article in its pores and interstices. Absorption capacity of a fabric article is measured in accordance with the following Test Protocol for Measuring Absorption Capacity of a Fabric Article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Test Protocol for Measuring the Absorption Capacity of a Fabric Article </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Rinse and dry a reservoir or other container into which a siloxane will be added. The reservoir is cleaned to free it from all extraneous matter, particularly soaps, detergents and wetting agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Weigh a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; fabric article to be tested to obtain the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; fabric article&apos;s weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Pour 2 L of a siloxane at &tilde;20 C into the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Step 4: Place fabric article from Step 2 into the siloxane-containing reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Step 5: Agitate the fabric article within the reservoir to ensure no air pockets are left inside the fabric article and it is thoroughly wetted with the siloxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Step 6: Remove the fabric article from the siloxane-containing reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Step 7: Unfold the fabric article, if necessary, so that there is no contact between same or opposite fabric article surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Step 8: Let the fabric article from Step 7 drip until the drop frequency does not exceed 1 drop/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Step 9: Weigh the &ldquo;wet&rdquo; fabric article from Step 8 to obtain the &ldquo;wet&rdquo; fabric article&apos;s weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Step 10: Calculate the amount of siloxane absorbed for the fabric article using the equation below. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FA</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>W&minus;D</italic></highlight>)/<highlight><italic>D*</italic></highlight>100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> FA&equals;fluid absorbed, % (i.e., the absorption capacity of the fabric article in terms of % by dry weight of the fabric article) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> W&equals;wet specimen weight, g </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> D&equals;initial specimen weight, g </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By the term &ldquo;non-immersive&rdquo; it is meant that essentially all of the fluid is in intimate contact with the fabric articles. There is at most minimal amounts of &ldquo;free&rdquo; wash liquor. It is unlike an &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; process where the washing fluid is a bath in which the fabric articles are either submerged, as in a conventional vertical axis washing machine, or plunged into, as in a conventional horizontal washing machine. The term &ldquo;non-immersive&rdquo; is defined in greater detail according to the following Test Protocol for Non-Immersive Processes. A process in which a fabric article is contacted by a fluid is a non-immerisive process when the following Test Protocol is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Test Protocol for Non-immersive Processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Determine absorption capacity of a fabric specimen using Test Protocol for Measuring Absorption Capacity of a Fabric Article, described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Subject a fabric article to a fluid contacting process such that a quantity of the fluid contacts the fabric article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Place a dry fabric specimen from Step 1 in proximity to the fabric article of Step 2 and move/agitate/tumble the fabric article and fabric specimen such that fluid transfer from the fabric article to the fabric specimen takes place (the fabric article and fabric specimen must achieve the same saturation level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Step 4: Weigh the fabric specimen from Step 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Step 5: Calculate the fluid absorbed by the fabric specimen using the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FA</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>W&minus;D</italic></highlight>)/<highlight><italic>D*</italic></highlight>100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> FA&equals;fluid absorbed, % </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> W&equals;wet specimen weight, g </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> D&equals;initial specimen weight, g </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Step 6: Compare the fluid absorbed by the fabric specimen with the absorption capacity of the fabric specimen. The process is non-immersive if the fluid absorbed by the fabric specimen is less than about 0.8 of the absorption capacity of the fabric specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;siloxane&rdquo;, as used herein, means silicone fluids which are non-polar and insoluble in water or lower alcohols. They are completely miscible in typical aliphatic and aromatic solvents, including the halogenated solvents, but are only partially miscible with the intermediate petrolium fractions such as naphthalenes. Linear siloxanes (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,443,747, and 5,977,040, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) and cyclic siloxanes are useful herein, including the cyclic siloxanes selected from the group consisting of octamethyl-cyclotetrasiloxane (tetramer), dodecamethyl-cyclohexasiloxane (hexamer), and preferably decamethyl-cyclopentasiloxane (pentamer, commonly referred to as &ldquo;D5&rdquo;). Most preferred are wash mediums wherein the siloxane comprises more than about 50% cyclic siloxane pentamer, more preferably more than about 75%, most preferably at least about 90% of the pentamer. Also preferred are wash mediums comprising siloxanes which are a mixture of cyclic siloxanes having at least about 90% (preferably at least about 95%) pentamer and less than about 10% (preferably less than about 5%) tetramer and/or hexamer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For the present invention process, the specific method for contacting the wash medium containing the siloxane with the fabric article may be any method which results in complete wetting of the fabric articles in the wash load by the automatic washing machine, in contrast to spot wetting and/or hand wetting of the fabric articles. This includes contacting the fabric articles in an immersive bath of the wash medium or, preferably, using lower volumes of wash medium as is possible by low volume wetting means such as spraying to uniformly wet the fabric articles. Most preferred is contacting the fabric articles using a method that comprises at least one non-immersive step whereby the fabric article is wetted with the wash medium (preferably by uniform spraying), for example only to the extent of less than about 500%, more preferably less than about 200% (even more preferably less than about 150%) to about 20%, more preferably to about 50% by dry weight of the fabric article in the wash load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves the contacting of the fabric articles with a wash medium comprising less than about 50% water, more preferably less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 1%, and most preferably no purposively added water. However, in another aspect of the present invention some amount of purposively added water is a part of the wash medium with the siloxane, including for example either immisible with the siloxane or as an emulsion comprising siloxane, water, and an emulsifying agent. Preferably the water comprises from about 0.1% to about 50%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 30%, from about 0.1% to about 20%, from about 0.1% to about 10%, from about 0.1% to about 5%, and from about 0.1% to about 1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the fabric articles to be treated and/or cleaned may be contacted with an impinging gas at any time during the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the fabric articles are contacted by an impinging gas at least prior to applying the cleaning fluid. The impinging gas facilitates the removal particulate soils from the fabric articles. Particulate soils can be successfully removed using gas flow. Particulate soils include any soil that is comprised of discrete particles. Nonlimiting examples of such particulate soils include clay, dust, dried mud, sand, cat fur, skin flakes or scales, dander, dandruff, hair from people or pets, grass seeds, pollen, burrs, and/or similar animal, mineral or vegetable matter which is insoluble in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By utilizing the impinging gas, &ldquo;demand&rdquo; on chemicals in the process for removing such particulate soils is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Typically, the impinging gas is flow from a gas source at a rate of from about 10 l/s to about 70 l/s and the gas contacts the fabric articles at a velocity of from about 1 m/s to about 155 m/s. It is desirable to mechanically agitate the fabric articles while the gas impinges on the fabric articles. Further, it is desirable to remove the gas, and particulate soils in the gas from the fabric articles at a rate sufficient to prevent the removed particulate soils from re-depositing upon the fabric articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention the gas is selected from the group consisting of air, nitrogen, ozone, oxygen, argon, helium, neon, xenon, and mixtures thereof, more preferably air, nitrogen, ozone, oxygen, argon, helium, and mixtures thereof, even more preferably still air, ozone, nitrogen, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention the gas used in the method can be varied over time. For example air could be used at the start of the process, a mixture of air and ozone used in the middle stages of the process and air or nitrogen could be used at the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The gas used may be of any suitable temperature or humidity. Heat could be supplied to the gas electrically or by passing the gas over a gas flame, such as, is done in a conventional gas dryer. However, room temperature and humidity gas are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention two or more gases could be mixed in a mixing chamber before being used in the process. In another aspect of this embodiment of the present invention the gases could be delivered concurrently through different entry points and mix in-situ in the walled vessel. In another aspect of this embodiment of the present invention the gases supplied could exist as mixture and would not require any mixing chamber to achieve the required mixture of gas for the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention the gas could be available from storage, such as from pressurized containers. Alternatively, the gas used in the process could be obtained from the location where the process and device occur. For example, a pump, blower, or the like, may be used to supply air from the surrounding atmosphere for the process of the invention. A combination of gas available from storage and from the atmosphere is also envisioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention the gas can be obtained from a compressor. The compressor may be any compressor suitable for providing gas or gases, provided that they supply the gas to the apparatus within the required velocity and flow rate ranges. The compressors are linked to the gas inlet(s) by an appropriate fixture, such as a hose, pipe, tap, fixture or combinations thereof, to provide the inlet(s) with the gas or gases within the required velocity and flow rate ranges. Some typical compressors, which are suitable for providing gas or gases, include rotary screw compressors or two-stage electrical compressor. Another suitable type of compressor is the so-called &ldquo;acoustical compressor&rdquo;, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,020,977, 5,051,066, 5,167,124, 5,319,938, 5,515,684, 5,231,337, and 5,357,757, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Typically, an acoustical compressor operates in the following fashion: A gas is drawn into a pulse chamber, such as air from the atmosphere, compressed, and then discharged as a high-pressure gas. The gas is compressed by the compressor sweeping a localized region of electromagnetic, for example microwaves, laser, infrared, radio etc, or ultrasonic energy through the gas in the pulse chamber at the speed of sound. This sweeping of the pulse chamber creates and maintain a high-pressure acoustic pulse in the gas. These acoustical compressors have many advantages over conventional compressors. For example, they have no moving parts besides the valves, operate without oil, and are much smaller than comparable conventional compressors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention the gas is provided from a gas source at a rate of from about 10 l/s to about 70 l/s, more preferably, about 20 l/s to about 42 l/s, even more preferably about 25 l/s to about 30 l/s. The gas flow rate is measure by a flow meter place in the internal space of the vessel close to where the gas enters the vessel containing the clothes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention the gas contacts the fabric articles at a velocity of from about 1 m/s to about 155 m/s, more preferably, about 50 m/s to about 105 m/s even more preferably about 75 m/s to about 105 m/s. The gas velocity is measure by a flow meter place in the internal space of the vessel close to where the gas enters the vessel containing the clothes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The velocity at which the gas contacts the fabric articles and the flow rate of the gas are critical parameters. For example insufficient velocity, means that the particulates are not removed from the fabric articles. Too great a velocity and the fabric articles are disrupted such that the fabric articles cannot be agitated and the particulate soils cannot be removed. Similarly, insufficient flow rate of the gas means that any particulate soils removed remain and can be re-deposited on the fabric article after cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Obviously the present invention process cannot use current conventional automatic washing machines as developed for aqueous wash processes. While automatic washing machines useful for the present process may be connected to a water source, such connection for purposes of carrying out the current process is solely for the supply of the optional purposively added water. A supply of the siloxane is necessary, preferably stored in a container for use in the current process and into which the siloxane is returned (following a suitable cleaning process) after contact with the fabric articles in the automatic home laundry process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> While an apparatus having the various components as defined for the immersive commercial dry cleaning process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,059,845, issued May 9, 2000, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,135, issued May 16, 2000 (both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), if modified for residential size and consumer maintenance, could be used to practice the present invention process, an immersive process for the present invention is not preferred. Reasons include the constraints (versus the commercial dry cleaner size and operation taught in these patents) associated with supplying, storing and cleaning larger volumes of siloxane in the home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For these reasons lower volume processes such as those utilizing a uniform spray process which completely wets the fabric articles with the lower volumes of wash medium as described herein before are highly preferred. For example modifications of conventional low water wash appliances to deliver low levels of siloxane-containing wash medium rather than a water wash medium should be considered; such conventional water wash appliances are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,574; 4,489,455; 5,191,669; 5,191,668; 5,233,718; and 5,671,494, all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A most preferred automatic washing machine useful for this low volume process is described in detail in the co-filed, copending patent application, P&amp;G Case 8119P, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Further preferred are automatic washing machines which guarantee homogeneous coverage of the fabric articles with the siloxane-containing wash medium by intermittent spin and spray followed by random tumbling until all the wash medium has been sprayed. Also preferred are such machines which reuse the siloxane-containing wash medium via an immediate re-use/recycling action, for example by passing the wash medium over a particle removal filter after extraction from the fabric articles and then immediately spraying it back onto the fabric articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further preferred automatic washing machines for practicing the present invention processes are designed to also dry the fabric articles in the same apparatus. This not only allows the consumer the convenience of not having to handle the wet fabric articles but also permits recovery of all the siloxane for reuse or cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It is also envisioned that adjuncts for cleaning and/or treating the fabric articles according to the desires of the consumer may be added to the process. The automatic washing machine therefore preferably includes recepticals for receiving and/or dispensing such adjuncts into the automatic laundry process at the desired time, either with the wash medium or separate from it. Cartridges containing such adjuncts (either through refilling or purchased with the adjunct) which releaseably attach to the machine are also optional executions. A particularly preferred adjunct is any material which functions as an antistatic agent when combined with the siloxane-containing wash medium in the present automatic home laundry process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> An additional preferred feature of the automatic washing machine is the ability to clean and reuse the siloxane for more than one automatic laundry process. A preferred means for cleaning the siloxane for multiple uses is a replaceable filter. Such filter should preferably include filter materials capable of removing and collecting at least the body soils removed from the fabric articles during the automatic home laundry process. Activated charcoal, silicas, molecular seives, and/or hydrophobically modified papers are just some optional components of such filters. The attachment to the automatic washing machine is preferably by means such that the consumer can readily replace it at regular intervals. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for the wet treatment of laundry items pursuant to the preamble of Claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Employed for the wet treatment of laundry items, particularly in commercial laundries, are so-called continuous tunnel washing machines which have a rotary driven drum which revolves about a preferably horizontal center axis. In the elongate drum, laundry items are, in a continuous pass, washed, rinsed and if necessary subjected to other treatment, in particular aftertreatment. The drum is driven in a preferably rotating, circulatory manner, thus executing complete circular movements during the wet treatment of the laundry. Arranged in the drum are built-in elements, in particular paddle blades. Permanently fixed in the drum, the paddle blades turn in the circumferential direction of the drum, thus serving to carry along the laundry within the drum and, according to need, to transport the laundry through the drum in its longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> During part of each revolution of the drum, the laundry lies in front of the paddle blades as well as upon the inner side of the drum. When, during the rotational actuation of the drum, the off-center paddle blades within the drum reach or pass through an upper cusp point (apex), the laundry drops into the interior of the drum due to gravity. This results in the laundry being thrown off the paddle blades and the inner side of the drum shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to increase the handling performance of tunnel washing machines, one aims at propelling the drum at the highest possible frequency of rotation, thus causing the drum to rotate at a correspondingly high speed. With increasing speed or rotational frequency, the laundry, particularly due to centrifugal forces, tends to adhere to the paddle blades and to the surfaces of the drum shell. This means that the laundry does not completely drop off when the paddle blades pass through the apex point in the drum. Having the laundry thrown off and drop down is essential for an effective washing and/or rinse cycle. Therefore, even incomplete throwing off and dropping down of the laundry results in a reduced intensity of the treatment; in particular, there is a drop in performance in washing and/or rinsing. The greater rotational frequency or driving speed of the drum thus becomes practically ineffective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Proceeding from the above, the invention is based on the problem of creating a method for a more effective and efficient wet treatment of laundry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A method for solving this problem is disclosed in the features of Claim 1. By having the drum driven at different rotational frequencies (in other words: different rotary frequencies or different number of revolutions), its rotational speed can be varied to meet these requirements. The disadvantages posed by driving the drum at a higher rotational frequency can be eliminated by a temporary or intermittent reduction of the rotational frequency. The faster drum drive speed at all other times can thus fully exploit the advantages of the drum action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The drum is driven preferably in rotation, with the drum being driven at different rotational frequencies during at least some, preferably during all, of its revolutions. The drum is thereby driven with a different velocity profile during at least some of its revolutions, with slower drive speeds being selected when disadvantages arising from too rapid drive speeds may be encountered. The drum is driven more rapidly in those circumferential areas of the drum in which higher drive speeds do not have a disadvantageous effect on the performance of treatment, in particular concerning washing and/or rinsing efficiency, which on the whole makes it possible to achieve a greater efficiency in treatment using tunnel washers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to a preferred method, the drum is driven at a plurality of, preferably two, different rotational frequencies during a respective revolution, with each frequency being held essentially constant during its segment of the drum revolution. Accordingly, the drum runs at the same speed in the respective area, which results in an even wet treatment of the laundry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also provided that the drum is to be braked or accelerated between the drive phases of the drum by means of applying a lower or higher rotational frequency, respectively. This gives a stepped velocity profile, with the phases of drum acceleration or braking serving to attain a higher or lower rotational frequency and/or circumferential speed (in other words: rotational speed) of the drum. In particular, braking the drum from the higher circumferential frequency to the lower circumferential frequency applies a impetus force on the laundry, which facilitates the loosening of the laundry from the drum and the paddle blades, and in particular ensures a more effective and above all more complete throwing off of the laundry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a further proposal of the invention, the drum is driven with the higher rotational frequency over a greater segment of its circumference that with the lower rotational frequency. This keeps the reduction of the drum drive speed to a minimum but at the same time retains to the maximum possible degree the performance advantage offered by the higher circumferential speed of the drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore provided that when built-in elements of the drum, in particular paddle blades for carrying along the laundry, reach an upper region of reversed direction (apex) of the drum, the drum is driven at a slower circumferential speed or rotational frequency. Accordingly, the drum is driven more slowly as the laundry is thrown off and this reduces the centrifugal forces which might otherwise hold the laundry to the paddle blades and inner side of the drum shell. This results in an effective and in particular complete throwing off of the laundry in that it can loosen more easily from the inner walls of the drum and the paddle blades due to the lower circumferential speed of the drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to a preferred embodiment of the method, when the paddle blades reach the upper reverse area of the drum&mdash;or even shortly before that&mdash;the drive of the drum is braked enough for the drum to shift from the higher rotational frequency to the lower rotational frequency. This braking action gives the laundry a dynamic impetus which favors its loosening from the paddle blades and the inner side of the drum wall, thus ensuring a reliable throwing off of the entire laundry at the apex of the drum. This not only represents an improvement in the efficiency of throwing off laundry at the apex region of blade motion by reducing the circumferential speed of the drum. This also favors and enhances the reliable throwing off of laundry by the braking of the drum required for reducing its rotational speed.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The shown tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is employed preferably for the wet treatment of laundry items in commercial laundries. In the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, schematically represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, are washed, rinsed and, if necessary, subjected to aftertreatment, such as a finishing. The tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a elongate drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a cylindrical drum shell. The drum can be driven rotationally about a horizontal longitudinal center axis <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the drum washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown here, the drum is driven completely or to a great extent in rotation. The drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thus executes complete circular revolutions in succession. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown here is divided into different zones, namely a washing zone, which may comprise a pre-wash zone and a clear-wash zone, a rinsing zone and, if necessary, a finishing zone. The washing zone, the rinsing zone and any finishing zone are arranged in the successive direction of treatment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The washing zone, the rinsing zone and also any finishing zone are formed from a plurality of successive chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with any number of chambers being possible, i.e. not limited to the number of those in the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In particular, the chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can have various built-in elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Arranged before a feed end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (at the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is a hopper feeder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be washed are introduced at the feed end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the hopper feeder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the shown exemplary embodiment, a discharge slide <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is arranged at the rear (right-hand side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) discharge end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Washed laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which exit the drum at the discharge end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, are transported out of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the discharge slide <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, if necessary to a following hydroextraction machine (not shown), such as a drainage press. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The individual chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are separated from one another by vertical partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> running perpendicular to the longitudinal center axis <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The individual chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are connected to the single-piece drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which runs continuously over the entire longitudinal center axis <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, in the regions of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> exhibit openings. Built-in elements, specifically paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, are provided between each two adjacent partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in preferably every chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In particular a paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided in each chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of all chambers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be of the same or different configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is movable by means of the bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, shown symbolically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, namely supported rotationally on a frame (not shown) of the tunnel washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured as running wheels on which the shell of the drum rests such that during the rotational drive of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the shell moves about the longitudinal center axis <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by rolling contact on the running wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven in a special manner. This drive action occurs at different rotational frequencies. In the shown exemplary embodiment, the drum is driven at two different rotational frequencies. Each of the two rotational frequencies is constant over a segment of the revolution of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The velocity profile for one revolution of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is represented schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> around the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the drum is driven over a greater segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of its circumference or of a revolution at a higher rotational frequency of up to fourteen revolutions per minute. This rotational frequency is constant over the greater segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the revolution of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven at a smaller, constant rotational frequency over a smaller segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of its circumference. The smaller rotational frequency has a maximum rate of 5 revolutions per minute, thus being a third less than the larger rotational frequency. Seen in the direction of revolution <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with the higher rotational frequency is followed by a braking phase <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which in turn extends over a small segment of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During the braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is steadily braked from the higher rotational frequency (segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) to the lower rotational frequency (segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Seen in the direction of revolution <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the lower rotational frequency is followed by an acceleration phase <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. This too extends over a small segment of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and serves to accelerate the drum from the lower rotational frequency (segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) to the higher rotational frequency (part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where it is driven with lower rotational frequency is located at the upper reversal area of the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the respective chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e. where the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reach the apex of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are here thrown off the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by dropping down in the chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which it is driven with the lower rotation frequency, begins approximately at that point where the middle of the paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reaches the highest point in the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e. where it intersects a vertical longitudinal center axis of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven with the lower rotational frequency, ends at the point where one end of the paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> meets the inner side of the shell of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This ensures that the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven at the constant lower rotational frequency when the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are thrown off the paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the respective chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This smaller segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which revolves at a constant lower speed, extends in the shown exemplary embodiment along approximately 32&deg; of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In contrast, segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, where the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven at the higher circumferential speed, is considerably larger, occupying in the shown exemplary embodiments approximately 305&deg; of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the shown exemplary embodiment extends about 13&deg; of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By comparison, the acceleration phase is somewhat smaller, extending namely in the exemplary embodiment only over approximately 10&deg; of the circumference of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Depending on the configuration of the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the segments <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for driving the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a constant higher or lower circumferential speed can be either larger or smaller than those of the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Likewise, the braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the acceleration phase <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be greater or smaller than those of the shown exemplary embodiment. The braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the acceleration phase <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can also be of the same magnitude if necessary, or the acceleration phase <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be greater than the braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The exact lengths of these phases depends no only on the configuration of the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and other built-in elements, but also on the ratio of the different speeds. They can therefore be varied to meet actual requirements so that the invention is not limited to the circumferential speed profile of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> By driving the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at different rotational frequencies, in particular with the speed profile shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, during a revolution of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is possible to drive it at a relatively high circumferential speed in such a phase where the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can and should lie on the inner side of the wall of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and temporarily also on the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the respective chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for being lifted out of the liquid bath <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, for throwing the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> off the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the drive of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is braked during the braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at constant deceleration to the lower circumferential speed. This lower circumferential speed is attained at the latest when the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> start to be thrown off the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, preferably somewhat later, with the deceleration occurring during the braking phase <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> favoring a loosening of the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the paddle blades <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and inner shell of the wall of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in particular by generating an additional throw-off impetus. As soon as the rear end of the paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> bordering the shell of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches the highest point in the chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, namely the apex of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the process of throwing the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> off the paddle blade <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is completed, the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is put under constant acceleration along the acceleration phase <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to attain the higher circumferential speed for lifting once again the laundry items <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> out of the liquid bath <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This operation can extend over singular, but also multiple complete revolutions of the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is also conceivable to drive the drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constantly with alternating rotational frequencies of various magnitudes, in particular with a circumferential speed profiles as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for detecting the unbalance condition of a load of material in an appliance and more particularly, for detecting an unbalance condition of a load of material in a rotatable vessel of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various appliances, such as automatic washing machines, automatic dryers, centrifugal liquid extractors, etc., utilize a rotating tub, basket or other vessel holding a load of material which may or may not be evenly distributed within the vessel. The condition of having the load unevenly distributed, or out of balance, creates a situation where the center of mass of the rotating vessel does not correspond to the geometric axis of the vessel. This leads to the generation of high loads and severe vibration of the vessel. In an appliance, this severe vibration may cause the phenomenon of movement of the appliance across the floor or other supporting surface. This can occur both in vertical axis rotating vessels as well as horizontal axis vessels and also in those appliances where the axis is arranged inbetween vertical and horizontal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various attempts have been provided in the prior art to provide mechanical arrangements to limit or reduce the possibility of unbalanced loads, which typically involve the addition of various masses, either fixed or movable, to the vessel which requires additional power for the motor to rotate the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Approaches have also been disclosed in the prior art for detecting a load imbalance, for example, in an inverter driven motor for a washing machine, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,565. That patent discloses to examine a ripple in the dc-inverter bus current, with a ripple value above a pre-determined level being indicative of load unbalance. If a load unbalance is detected, the washer controller would resume a redistribution cycle to attempt to re-balance the clothes. This would be attempted a predetermined number of times and, if the load is still unbalanced, the spin cycle would be aborted. If the ripple value falls below the pre-determined level before the maximum number of tries is reached, the spin cycle is started. Once a spin cycle has been initiated, the length of the spin cycle is determined on the basis of the magnitude of any remaining load unbalance. Spin rate and spin time may be adjusted based upon the degree of load unbalance detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It would be an advance if a method and apparatus were provided in which the potential for a severe unbalance could be predicted in advance of it actually occurring so that appropriate steps could be taken to avoid the detrimental effects of such a condition. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method and apparatus for detecting a severe unbalance condition in a rotating device such as a basket, tub or other rotatable vessel of an appliance, for example an automatic washer. The method and apparatus provide the detecting by monitoring the motor current signature. When a severe unbalance condition is detected at a high rotational speed, the spin speed can be adaptively dropped down to a safe level, in which the appliance vibrations and mechanical stresses are tolerable. The appliance system can be continuously monitored so that, in the case of an appliance such as an automatic washer, clothes dryer or centrifugal water extraction, as water is extracted from the fabric load, and the load becomes less massive, the spin speed can be gradually increased to a desired level. If too great of an unbalance condition still persists, the spin speed can be adaptably limited or the cycle can be terminated and the user can be advised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The effect of unbalanced loads in a motor driven rotating component, such as a rotatable vessel, translates into motor torque oscillations, which are proportional to the motor stator currents. Moreover, increased vibrations in certain appliances cause energy dissipation in passive components, such as in the suspension system, causing the average motor current to increase. In the case of a controlled induction motor (CIM), the stator currents are estimated by directly measuring the dc bus current of the inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, motor torque oscillations are monitored as the vessel rotational speed is increased in a series of steps and a severe unbalance condition is detected as soon as it happens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A stepped speed profile is commanded to the motor by the control system in order to obtain information about the load. The average energy that is required by the appliance to spin the vessel is monitored by means of averaging the motor stator current. Under normal conditions, the motor current can increase due to several conditions: acceleration torque due to speed profiles, mechanical drag in the system (i.e., bearings friction, viscous forces, etc.) or energy dissipation by the shock absorbers in the suspension system (i.e., when severe unbalanced loads are present). By carefully choosing the acceleration rates of the speed profiles and using self-referencing techniques, it is possible to minimize the effects of inertia and mechanical drag in the system. It is therefore possible to relate the motor average current to the mechanical dissipation of the shock absorbers and to the unbalance in the load. In a typical speed profile for a spin cycle, several regions can be identified, each characterized by a speed ramp during which the speed is increased, and a plateau where the speed is held constant. The speed ramps should be carefully chosen in order to avoid masking the effect of unbalanced loads on the motor current with the effect of acceleration torque and inertia (i.e., load size). At the beginning of each of these regions, thresholds are dynamically established for the motor current. When the motor current exceeds these thresholds, a severe unbalance condition for the load is assumed. In order to minimize the effect of mechanical drag, a base line for the motor current is acquired at the beginning of each region (end of previous speed plateau). In this condition there is no contribution due to the inertia (speed is constant) and the base line reflects the mechanical drag present in the system. The threshold for the motor current is established as a fixed offset (determined experimentally) above the base line. In order to increase the accuracy of the algorithm, the offset is higher during the speed ramp (to account for higher currents due to acceleration torque) and lower during the speed plateau (no acceleration, only mechanical drag). It is then possible to dynamically create a threshold profile that matches closely the speed profile and that accounts for the system mechanical drag (base line). The thresholds are determined separately for the ramp and for the plateau portions of the spin speed profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To further improve the reliability of the algorithm, the thresholds are also adjusted to account for variations in line voltage. The motor current for a given torque-speed operating point depends on the voltage supplied to the motor. When driving the motor with an inverter, the maximum possible voltage is delivered to the motor during parts of the spin speed profile. This maximum voltage applied to the motor depends directly on the line supply voltage provided to the inverter and no regulation for the voltage supplied to the motor is possible in this condition. It has been experimentally determined that when the voltage is low, the current is higher for a given torque-speed point and vice versa. A simple inverse proportional compensation is used to adjust the thresholds to the line voltage.</paragraph>

The spin basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> defines a wash chamber and includes an inside wall surface extending upwardly from a substantially flat bottom. A motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through a transmission to rotate the basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> relative to the stationary tub <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. All of the components inside the cabinet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are supported by struts <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and there may also be provided various passive elements such as shock absorbers or springs to absorb vibrations and movements of the basket and tub relative to the frame and cabinet of the washing machine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comprises a vessel into which materials such as a fabric load may be charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> During the course of operation of an appliance such as an automatic washer, the wash basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated at relatively high speeds in order to extract water or other wash liquids from the clothes load. If the clothes load is not evenly distributed within the wash basket, an unbalance condition occurs which will cause the rotating basket to oscillate around the axis of rotation. Hence there will be some movement of the basket in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Depending upon the degree of unbalance and the speed of rotation, the oscillation may be small or it may be large enough to actually cause the basket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (and tub) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to engage the washer cabinet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or some other relatively stationary component of the appliance with some level of force. Continued operation in such a mode could cause severe damage to the washer and could cause the entire appliance to move from its otherwise stationary location, which could cause other damage or possibly hazardous conditions in the proximity of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The effect of unbalanced loads also causes motor torque oscillations which are proportional to the motor stator currents. Also, increased vibrations cause energy dissipation in passive components of the suspension system, in turn, causing the average motor current to increase. In a motor such as a controlled induction motor, the stator currents are estimated by directly measuring the dc-bus current of the inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method and apparatus for detecting an unbalance condition in a rotatable vessel as soon as a severe unbalance condition occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Typically an unbalanced condition becomes more severe as rotation speed increases. Therefore, the present method and apparatus contemplate monitoring the motor current after the vessel has been accelerated up to a predetermined minimum speed level which may depend on the particular appliance involved, the mass of its load, etc. However, the speed should be selected based upon a value, below which damage or severe vibration due to load unbalance is unlikely and above which damage or severe vibration could be likely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates graphically a spin profile showing rotational speed over time. A series of acceleration periods <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, or speed ramps, as well as a series of plateaus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or constant speeds are illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates average motor current <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> during acceleration and constant speed modes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates a varying threshold level <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is determined experimentally as a fixed offset above a base line, separately for each speed ramp and each speed plateau. A base line for the motor current is acquired at the beginning of each region (end of previous speed plateau) as shown at <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In this condition, there is no contribution due to inertia and the base line reflects the mechanical drag present in the system. The threshold value for the motor current is established as a fixed offset (determined experimentally) above the base line. In order to increase the accuracy of the algorithm, the offset is higher during the ramp speed <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to account for higher currents due to acceleration torque and lower during the speed plateau <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>where there is no acceleration, only mechanical drag. It is then possible to dynamically create a threshold profile that matches closely to speed profile and that accounts for the system mechanical drag. Also, a predetermined delay period is added following a drop in current demand following an acceleration period before the plateau threshold is implemented to permit the motor current to settle down following an acceleration. This can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> where motor current <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> drops prior to the threshold value dropping from level <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The threshold values for ramp and plateau are calculated at the beginning of each new region as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Threshold<highlight><subscript>ramp</subscript></highlight>&equals;base line&plus;offset<highlight><subscript>ramp</subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Threshold<highlight><subscript>plateau</subscript></highlight>&equals;baseline&plus;offset<highlight><subscript>plateau</subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To further improve the reliability of the algorithm, the thresholds are also adjusted to account for variations in the line voltage. The motor current for a given torque-speed operating point depends on the voltage supplied to the motor. It has been experimentally determined that when the voltage is low the current is higher for a given torque-speed point and visa-versa. A simple inverse proportional compensation is then used to adjust the thresholds to the line voltage.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Threshold<highlight><subscript>ramp</subscript></highlight>&equals;(base line&plus;offset<highlight><subscript>ramp</subscript></highlight>)&times;(voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>/voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>).</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Threshold<highlight><subscript>plateau</subscript></highlight>&equals;(base line&plus;offset<highlight><subscript>plateau</subscript></highlight>)&times;(voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>/voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>).</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Thus, a standard constant level threshold above the motor current is not utilized, but rather a varying threshold based upon the condition of the rotating vessel, that is whether it is being accelerated or whether it is being rotated at constant speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A still more accurate voltage compensation can be implemented, in which a different gain factor is used for voltages above and below nominal:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>If (voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>&lt;voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>) then Threshold&equals;(base line&plus;offset)&times;(voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>/voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>)&times;K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Otherwise if (voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>&gt;voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>) then Threshold&equals;(base line&plus;offset)&times;(voltage<highlight><subscript>nominal</subscript></highlight>/voltage<highlight><subscript>actual</subscript></highlight>)&times;K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are coefficients optimized experimentally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The precise initial threshold speed, rate of acceleration and speed after each acceleration may be varied, depending on the particular appliance involved, the size or mass of the typical load of material that the vessel is charged with, the severity of unbalance that may be expected, typical final rotational speeds for the vessel, and other parameters known to those skilled in the art. What is important is that the initial threshold rotational speed be chosen so that the speed is not so high as to cause damage to the appliance or damage to the user if an unbalance condition exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If an out of balance signal is generated, this could lead to various further steps including a reduction of the spin speed to a lower level at which the appliance vibrations and mechanical stresses are tolerable. The control can continuously monitor the current draw so that as water is extracted from the clothes and load becomes lighter, the spin speed can be gradually increased to a maximum desired value. Alternatively, if the out of balance condition is too severe, the appliance user can be advised by an appropriate visible or audible signal and the cycle stopped until the user manually redistributes the material load and resets the control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides an apparatus as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in which there is an appliance <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which comprises a vessel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> mounted for rotation about an axis and configured to receive a supply of material whereby the vessel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> will vibrate in a severe unbalance loading condition of the material in the vessel while the vessel is rotating. The vessel is caused to rotate by a motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is operatively connected to the vessel to rotate the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A control <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the motor to operate the motor at various predetermined speeds and to accelerate the motor between those speeds at predetermined rates. A current drawn by the motor at the various speeds and during the accelerations is measured by the control and compared to a pre-calculated threshold at each speed and acceleration period to determine whether the vessel is out of balance. If the threshold for a particular speed or acceleration period is exceeded, the control sends a signal indicative of an unbalance condition which can be used to provide a visible or audible signal to a user or to have the control take further steps to minimize the vibration of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the foregoing specification, the invention is susceptible of being embodied with various alterations and modifications which may differ particularly from those that have been described in the preceding specification and description. It should be understood that we wish to embody within the scope of the patent warranted hereon all such modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of our contribution to the art. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, in particular human hair, containing at least one pyrazoline-3,5-dione compound as coupler and at least one oxidation base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to dye keratin fibres, and in particular human hair, with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, in particular ortho- or para-phenylene diamines, ortho- or para-aminophenols, and heterocyclic compounds, which are generally referred to as oxidation bases. Oxidation dye precursors, or oxidation bases, are colorless or weakly colored compounds which, when combined with oxidizing products, can give rise to colored compounds and dyes by a process of oxidative condensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known that the shades obtained with these oxidation bases can be varied by combining them with couplers or color modifiers, the latter being chosen in particular from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds such as indole compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> the variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colors to be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The so-called &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; coloration obtained by means of these oxidation dyes must moreover satisfy a certain number of requirements. Thus, it must have no toxicological drawbacks, it must allow shades to be obtained in the desired intensity and it must show good resistance to external agents (light, bad weather, washing, permanent-waving, perspiration, rubbing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The dyes must also be able to cover grey hair and, lastly, they must be as unselective as possible, i.e. they must allow only the smallest possible color differences to be obtained along the length of the same keratin fibre, which may, indeed, be differently sensitized (i.e. damaged) between its tip and its root. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has now discovered that it is possible to obtain novel, powerful, unselective and particularly resistant dyes, which are capable of giving rise to intense colorations in varied shades, by using pyrazoline-3,5-dione compounds as couplers in the presence of an oxidation base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This discovery forms the basis of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The subject or the invention is a composition for dyeing keratin fibres, and in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, characterized in that it comprises, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> as coupler, a least one pyrazoline-3,5-dione compound of formula (I), or one of the addition salts thereof with an acid;

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hair dye composition which has markedly high hair dyeing power, can impart the hair with a vivid and deep color shade ranging from greenish yellow to reddish yellow, has less color fade over time and undergoes a smaller change in the color tone of the dye even after storage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Hair dyes can be classified by the dye to be used therefor, or whether they have bleaching action of melanin or not. Typical examples include a two-part permanent hair dye composed of a first part containing an alkali agent, an oxidation dye and a direct dye such as nitro dye and a second part containing an oxidizing agent; and one-part semi-permanent hair dye containing an organic acid or an alkali agent, and a direct dye such as acid dye, basic dye or nitro dye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The above-described permanent hair dye is however accompanied with the drawbacks that color tone imparted by an oxidation dye is not so vivid and the color of the hair dyed with a vivid-color producing nitro dye ordinarily employed as a direct dye markedly fades over time and becomes dull soon even if the color tone rightly after dyeing is very vivid (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Hei 6-271435). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, hair dyes containing as a direct dye a so-called cationic dye having a cation group contained in their conjugate system have been reported (Japanese Language Laid-Open Publication (PCT) No. Hei 8-507545, 8-501322 or 10-502946, or Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Hei 10-194942). They have been found to involve drawbacks that intended dyeing effects are not available owing to decomposition of them caused by mixing, upon hair dyeing, with hydrogen peroxide ordinarily employed as an oxidizing agent; and that when the cation group is incorporated in an azo(&mdash;N&boxH;N)-based conjugated system, they are unstable to an alkali agent or a reducing agent essentially contained in a permanent hair dye. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a hair dye composition which features high hair dyeing power, less color fade over time and excellent storage stability permitting only a smaller color tone change of the dye after storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have found that when the below-described compound which is known (in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. Sho 53-8619) as a disperse dye for dry transfer printing of acidic modified synthetic fibers or as C.I. Basic Yellow 2 is used as a hair dye, the resulting dye composition can impart the hair with a vivid and deep color shade ranging from greenish yellow to reddish yellow without decomposing the dye upon hair dyeing, exhibits excellent light resistance, washing resistance, perspiration resistance, friction resistance and weather resistance, and undergoes a smaller change in the color tone of the dye after storage as compared with that rightly after preparation, because it exists stably in the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, there is thus provided a hair dye composition comprising, as a direct dye, an azamethine compound represented by the following formula (1):

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The direct dye (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is preferably added in an amount of 0.01 to 20 wt. %, more preferably 0.05 to 10 wt. %, especially 0.1 to 5 wt. % on the basis of the entirety of the composition (after mixing of all the parts when a two-part or three-part composition is employed; this will apply equally hereinafter). When another direct dye is used in combination, the content of it with the direct dye (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) preferably ranges from 0.05 to 10 wt. %, especially 0.1 to 5 wt. % based on the whole composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hair dye composition of the present invention is preferably adjusted to pH 6 to 11, with pH 8 to 11 being more preferred. Examples of the alkali agent to be used for pH adjustment includes ordinarily employed ones such as ammonia, organic amines and salts thereof. The alkali agent is preferably added in an amount of 0.01 to 20 wt. %, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt. %, especially 0.5 to 5 wt. %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the hair dye composition of the present invention, an oxidizing agent can be incorporated. In this case, hair dyeing and bleaching can be carried out simultaneously, which facilitates more vivid hair dyeing. Ordinarily employed oxidizing agents, for example, hydrogen peroxide, persulfates such as ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate and sodium persulfate, perborates such as sodium perborate, percarbonates such as sodium percarbonate and bromates such as sodium bromate and potassium bromate are usable. Out of them, hydrogen peroxide is especially preferred. The oxidizing agent is added in an amount of 0.5 to 10 wt. %, especially 1 to 8 wt. %, on the basis of the entirety of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the hair dye composition of the present invention, an oxidation dye can be incorporated further. This incorporation enables markedly vivid dyeing not attainable by the single use of an oxidation dye. As the oxidizing agent, the above-exemplified oxidizing agents can be used, with hydrogen peroxide being particularly preferred. Alternatively, an oxidizing enzyme such as laccase can be employed. For the oxidation dye, known developers and couplers ordinarily employed for an oxidation type hair dye can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Examples of the developer include p-phenylenediamines having one or several groups selected from NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, NHR&mdash; and NR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-groups (R represents a C<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group) such as p-phenylenediamine, p-toluylenediamine, N-methyl-p-phenylenediamine, chloro-p-phenylenediamine, 2-(2&prime;-hydroxyethylamino)-5-aminotoluene, N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 2,6-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, methoxy-p-phenylenediamine, 2,6-dichloro-p-phenylenediamine, 2-chloro-6-methyl-p-phenylenediamine, 6-methoxy-3-methyl-p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-diaminoanisole, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-p-phenylenediamine and N-2-methoxyethyl-p-phenylenediamine; 2,5-diaminopyridine derivatives and 4,5-diaminopyrazole derivatives; p-aminophenols such as p-aminophenol, 2-methyl-4-aminophenol, N-methyl-p-aminophenol, 3-methyl-4-aminophenol, 2,6-dimethyl-4-aminophenol, 3,5-dimethyl-4-aminophenol, 2,3-dimethyl-4-aminophenol and 2,5-dimethyl-4-aminophenol; o-aminophenols, o-phenylenediamines, 4,4&prime;-diaminophenylamine and hydroxypropylbis(N-hydroxyethyl-p-phenylenediamine); and salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Examples of the coupler include 1-naphthol, 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene, 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene, 5-amino-2-methylphenol, 5-(2&prime;-hydroxyethylamino)-2-methylphenol, 2,4-diaminoanisole, m-toluylenediamine, resorcin, m-phenylenediamine, m-aminophenol, 4-chlororesorcin, 2-methylresorcin, 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol, 2,6-diaminopyridine, 2-amino-3-hydroxypyridine, 4-hydroxyindole, 6-hydroxyindole, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 2-amino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine, 4-amino-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine, 4,6-diamino-2-hydroxypyrimidine and 1,3-bis(2,4-diaminophenoxy)propane; and salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As a developer or coupler, at least one of the above-exemplified ones can be used. Although no particular limitation is imposed on its content, it is added in an amount of 0.01 to 20 wt. %, especially 0.5 to 10 wt. % based on the whole composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> To the hair dye composition of the present invention, a known autoxidation dye typified by an indole or an indoline, or a known direct dye such as a nitro dye or a disperse dye can also be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Addition of a polyol, polyol alkyl ether, cationic or amphoteric polymer or silicone to the hair dye composition of the present invention is preferred, because the resulting hair dye composition can dye the hair uniformly and has improved cosmetic effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described components, those ordinarily employed as a raw material for cosmetics can be added to the hair dye composition of the present invention, within an extent not impairing the advantages of the present invention. Examples of such an optional component include hydrocarbons, animal or vegetable fats and oils, higher fatty acids, organic solvents, penetration promoters, cationic surfactants, natural or synthetic polymers, higher alcohols, ethers, amphoteric surfactants, nonionic surfactants, protein derivatives, amino acids, antiseptics, chelating agents, stabilizing agents, antioxidants, plant extracts, crude drug extracts, vitamins, colorants, perfumes and ultraviolet absorbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The hair dye composition of the present invention can be prepared in a conventional manner into a one-part composition, a two-part composition having a first-part component containing an alkali agent and a second-part component containing an oxidizing agent, or a third-part composition having, in addition to these two components, a powdery oxidizing agent such as persulfate. The direct dye (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) can be incorporated in either one or both of these components of the two-part or three-part composition. The one-part type is applied to the hair directly, while the two- or three-part type is applied to the hair after mixing these parts upon hair dyeing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> No particular limitation is imposed on the form of the hair dye composition of the present invention. Examples include powder, transparent liquid, emulsion, cream, gel, paste, aerosol, and aerosol foam. It preferably has a viscosity of 2000 to 100000 mPa&bull;s in the stage of application to the hair (after mixing of all the parts when a two-part or three-part type composition is employed).</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to new p-aminophenol derivative compounds with substituents in the 2-position and compositions for dyeing keratin fibers, especially human hair, containing these new compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Oxidation dye compounds have long attained substantial importance in the art of dyeing keratin fibers, especially hair dyeing. The dyeing caused by those compounds occurs by reaction of certain developer substances with certain coupler substances in the presence of a suitable oxidizing agent. For example, 2,5-diaminotoluene, 2,5-diaminophenylethyl alcohol, p-aminophenol and 1,4-diaminobenzene can be used as developer substances, while resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, 1-naphthol, 3-aminophenol and derivatives of m-phenylen-diamine can be mentioned as coupler substances. There are numerous additional requirements for oxidation dye compounds that are used to dye human hair besides color in the desired intensity. Thus the dye compounds must be unobjectionable in regard to toxicological and dermatological properties and must provide the desired hair color with a good light fastness, fastness to a permanent wave treatment, acid fastness and fastness to rubbing. The color of the hair dyed with the dye compounds in each case must be stable for at least 4 to 6 weeks to light, rubbing and chemical agents. Furthermore an additional requirement is the production of a broad palette of different color shades using different developer and coupler substances. To obtain natural and especially fashionable color shades in the red region p-aminophenol is used, alone or in a mixture with another developer substance, in combination with a suitable coupler substance. Introduction of substituents on the p-aminophenol to improve its properties has already been attempted. DE-OS 196 07 751 discloses dye compositions, which contain p-aminophenol compounds with substituents in the 2-position acting as developer substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is not possible to fulfill all the above-mentioned requirements with the currently known dye compounds. There is thus a need for new developer substances that fulfill the above-mentioned requirements in special ways. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide improved developer compounds that fulfill the above-described requirements in a special manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has now been surprisingly found that the new p-aminophenol derivative compounds according to formula (I) fulfill the many requirements for developer compounds to an especially great extent. Particularly bright or intense color shades are produced using these developer substances with predominantly known coupler substances, which are however extraordinarily light fast and fast to washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The subject matter of the present invention thus includes p-aminophenol derivative compounds of formula (I), or their physiologically compatible water-soluble salts,

For example, the wetting agents and emulsifiers are used in concentrations of from about 0.5 to 30 percent by weight, the thickeners are used in an amount of from about 0.1 to 25 percent by weight and the care materials are used in concentrations of from about 0.1 to 5.0 percent by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The dye compositions according to the invention can be weakly acidic, neutral or alkaline according to their composition. The compositions preferably have a pH from 6.5 to 11.5. Their pH can be adjusted in the basic range with ammonia. Also organic amines can be used for this purpose, including monoethanolamine and triethanolamine, or also inorganic bases, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Inorganic or organic acids can be used for adjusting the pH in the acid range, for example phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid or tartaric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to use the oxidation hair dye composition for dyeing hair the above-described dye compositions according to the invention are mixed with an oxidizing agent immediately prior to use and an amount of the mixture sufficient to dye the hair is applied to the hair, according to the hair abundance, generally from about 60 to 200 grams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Principally hydrogen peroxide, or its addition compounds with urea, melamine, sodium borate or sodium carbonate, can be used in the form of a 3 to 12 percent, preferably 6 percent, aqueous solution as the oxidizing agent for developing the hair dye. Air oxygen can also be used as the oxidizing agent. If a 6 percent hydrogen peroxide solution is used as oxidizing agent, the weight ratio of hair dye composition and oxidizing agent is 5:1 to 1:2, but preferably 1:1. Larger amounts of oxidizing agent are used above all with larger dye concentrations in the hair dye composition, or when at the same time a strong bleaching of the hair is desired. The mixture of the oxidizing agent and the dye composition of the invention is allowed to act on the hair for about 10 to 45 minutes, preferably 30 minutes, at 15 to 50 degrees Celsius. The hair is then rinsed with water and dried. If necessary it is washed with a shampoo and eventually after-rinsed with a weak organic acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid. Subsequently the hair is dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The hair dye composition according to the invention with a content of diaminobenzene derivative compounds of formula (1) as developer substance permits hair dyeing with outstanding color fastness, especially light fastness, fastness to washing and fastness to rubbing. The dye composition according to the invention provides a broad palette of different color shades, which extend from blond to brown, purple, violet to blue and black shades, according to the type and composition of the dye compounds in it. Particularly the color shades produced have outstanding color intensity. The very good dyeing properties of the compositions according to the invention include the production of good color coverage and dyeing of gray, chemically not-previously damaged hair without problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for recovering from dyestuff-containing information recording media having a dyestuff-containing layer the dyestuff contained in said dyestuff-containing layer, and also to a solvent used for dyestuff recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Being capable of high-density recording, optical information recording media are widely used to record music, images, and information. Among other things, compact disks (CD) and discoid recording media of similar type are in general use. Under this situation, the recycling of discoid recording media has become an issue under discussion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Optical disks now on the market are mostly of the read-only type such as music CD. They are of laminate structure, consisting of a substrate of polycarbonate or the like and a reflecting film of aluminum or the like and a protective film of acrylic resin or the like which are formed consecutively on the substrate (although not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Optical disks of this structure have induced one to devise several methods for their recycling. Among them is crushing disks whole, followed by molding. A disadvantage of this method is that the components of the reflecting film and protective film enter the crushed product, making it impossible to recover the reflecting film only. In addition, this method gives rise to opaque molded products which merely find reuse in limited applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By contrast, another method, which is intended to reuse the substrate resin, is by immersing disks in an acidic or alkaline solution so as to dissolve the reflecting film (aluminum) and separate the protective film from the substrate. This method offers an advantage of giving rise to a recovered substrate resin which is transparent and finds reuse in a comparatively wide range of applications, although there is room for improvement in the recovery of the reflecting film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, the family of CD on the market includes recordable CD as well as the above-mentioned read-only CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An example of such recordable CD is one which is composed of a substrate of resin such as polycarbonate and laminate layers consecutively formed thereon, including a recording layer with a dyestuff such as cyanine dye, and a reflecting film of gold or aluminum, and a protective film of acrylic resin or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, commercially available are dye-based optical disks of write-once type, which are referred to as CD-R (Compact Disk Recordable). Akin to CD-R is DVD-R (Digital Video Disk Recordable) for high-density recording, which is formed by sticking two pieces of CD-R together. These disks are usually capable of writing only once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In other words, these dye-based optical disks of write-once type have a recording layer which contains a dyestuff. They permit the recording and reproduction of information owing to their property that the recording layer changes in state according as the dye undergoes irreversible change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the dye-based optical disk of write-once type as mentioned above, the dyestuff partly changes in its state upon recording (or writing). The rate of change, however, is usually about 20%, with the rest (about 80%) remaining unchanged. In fact, about 80% of the total amount remains unchanged even in the case where the recording pattern is used up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Since the dyestuff used for the optical disk of this type is expensive and valuable, it is desirable for cost reduction and effective resource use to recover and reuse it efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One known method for recycling dye-based optical disks resorts to buffing to separate the substrate resin from the reflecting film. A disadvantage of this method is that buffing mechanically removes the dyestuff together with the reflecting film, making its recovery difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At present, the dye-based optical disk of write-once type employs an organic dyestuff (such as cyanine dye and phthalocyanine dye) in its dye-containing layer. In one instance, the dyestuff is mixed with a singlet oxygen quencher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A quencher is a kind of stabilizer to protect the dyestuff from decomposition. Dyestuff is usually subject to oxidation and decomposition, which decrease its effect, in the presence of oxygen and light. A common way to protect dyestuff from deactivation (oxidation and decomposition) by oxygen is to incorporate a quencher into the dyestuff-containing layer beforehand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Because the deactivation of dyestuff takes place in the presence of oxygen and light, no singlet oxygen quencher is necessary if the dyestuff-containing layer is closely sealed and completely isolated from oxygen by the reflecting film and protective film immediately after the spin coating and drying of the dyestuff-containing material. In fact, there exists a dye-based optical disk containing no quencher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Dyestuff is subject to photo-oxidative decomposition, as mentioned above. However, it is practically very difficult to completely shut out oxygen in the course of dyestuff recovery which involves steps of dissolving the dyestuff-containing layer, concentrating the resulting solution, and separating the desired dyestuff by column chromatography. Moreover, there is an instance where the dyestuff is incorporated with a photosensitizer which would promote deactivation upon heating for concentration. Especially, an efficient recovery of dyestuff from the dyestuff-containing layer free from quencher is difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Even though the dyestuff-containing layer is incorporated with a singlet oxygen quencher beforehand, it is difficult to prevent the entrance of oxygen, thereby protecting the dyestuff from oxidation and decomposition completely, in various steps in the course of dyestuff recovery. In other words, the recovery of dyestuff from the dyestuff-containing layer with a singlet oxygen quencher is also limited in efficiency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention was completed to address the above-mentioned problems involved in the prior art technology. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for recovering from dyestuff-containing information recording media having a dyestuff-containing layer the dyestuff contained in said dyestuff-containing layer, and also to provide a solvent used for dyestuff recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> After a series of researches conducted to address the above-mentioned problem, the present inventors found that it is possible to recover the desired dyestuff efficiently from dye-containing information recording media (such as dye-based optical disks of write-once type) having a dyestuff-containing layer by treating the dyestuff-containing layer with a solvent containing a singlet oxygen quencher prior to dyestuff recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The gist of the present invention resides in a process for recovering from dyestuff-containing information recording media having at least a dyestuff-containing layer the dyestuff contained in said dyestuff-containing layer, said process comprising treating said dyestuff-containing layer with a solvent containing a singlet oxygen quencher. (This process will be referred to as the dyestuff recovery process of the invention hereinafter.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The dyestuff recovery process of the invention involves treatment of the dyestuff-containing layer with a solvent containing a singlet oxygen quencher. This offers an advantage of protecting the dyestuff from photo-oxidative decomposition and state change by oxygen, because the singlet oxygen quencher is more reactive to oxygen (active oxygen or excited singlet oxygen) than to the dyestuff. The result is an efficient recovery of the dyestuff in high purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> By the singlet oxygen quencher mentioned above is meant an agent to deactivate singlet oxygen which affects the oxidation of the dyestuff. It reacts preferentially with oxygen, thereby protecting the dyestuff from oxidation. (A detailed description will be given later.) The gist of the present invention resides also in a solvent used to recover from dyestuff-containing information recording media having at least a dyestuff-containing layer the dyestuff contained in said dyestuff-containing layer, said solvent containing therein a singlet oxygen quencher. (This solvent will be referred to as the dyestuff recovery solvent of the invention hereinafter.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The dyestuff recovery solvent of the present invention protects the dyestuff from decomposition and state change by oxygen for the same reason as above. Therefore, it permits stable dissolution of the dyestuff in high concentrations, which in turn leads to an efficient recovery of the dyestuff in high purity.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> First, the action of the singlet oxygen quencher will be explained in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Dyestuff usually exists in the stable ground state. However, it assumes the excited triplet state when acted on by ultraviolet rays. Such an excited dyestuff is active enough to react with triplet oxygen (ordinary molecular oxygen) in the presence of oxygen, thereby forming singlet oxygen. This singlet oxygen is so active as to react with the dyestuff to oxidize, decompose, and disable it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The singlet oxygen quencher, which is more reactive to singlet oxygen than to dyestuff, reacts preferentially with singlet oxygen, thereby protecting the dyestuff from photo-oxidative decomposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If a solvent containing the singlet oxygen quencher is used to treat the dyestuff-containing layer at the time of recovery from dye-based optical disks the dyestuff contained in the dyestuff-containing layer, it is possible to protect the dyestuff from oxidation and decomposition, thereby permitting an efficient recovery of the dyestuff. Incidentally, the singlet oxygen quencher may be regarded as a kind of trapping agent for singlet oxygen rather than a UV light absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the dyestuff recovery process of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the dyestuff recovery process of the present invention, the above-mentioned dyestuff-containing information recording media are a dye-based optical disk of write-once type (such as CD-R) which is composed at least of a substrate, a dyestuff-containing layer as a recording layer, a reflecting film, and a protective film, which are arranged in the order mentioned. The process comprises a first step of separating (or peeling) said substrate and said dyestuff-containing layer from said reflecting film and said protective film, a second step of extracting said dyestuff from said dyestuff-containing layer using a solvent containing said singlet oxygen quencher, a third step of concentrating said dyestuff, which has been extracted in said second step, by using a rotary evaporator or the like, and a fourth step of separating said dyestuff, which has been concentrated in said third step, by means of liquid chromatography or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The process comprising the above-mentioned steps permits the efficient recovery of said dyestuff in high purity. It also permits the adequate recovery of said substrate, said reflecting film, and said protective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the dyestuff recovery process of the invention, it is desirable that said solvent be freed of oxygen and then incorporated with said singlet oxygen quencher before it is used for dyestuff recovery. The removal of oxygen from said solvent may be accomplished by introducing (bubbling) an inert gas, such as nitrogen and argon into said solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Said dyestuff is stable (with a weak tendency to become deactivated) by nature in an inert gas atmosphere or in the absence of oxygen. In actual dyestuff recovery, however, it will come into contact with oxygen because it is difficult to keep the dyestuff from oxygen completely during dissolution, concentration, and separation, or during transfer from one step to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Oxygen removal by bubbling, which can be carried out with a comparatively simple equipment, is effective in reducing the amount of said singlet oxygen quencher used in the dyestuff recovery process of the invention and also in suppressing the decomposition of said dyestuff further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In practicing the dyestuff recovery process of the invention, it is desirable to carry out at least the first step in an inert gas atmosphere in the dark in order to protect said dyestuff from photo-oxidative decomposition in the first to fourth steps. It is also desirable to carry out concentration (in the third step) under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C., taking into account the efficiency of solvent evaporation and the decomposition temperature of the dyestuff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For the reasons mentioned above, it is desirable to carry out the first to fourth steps and other additional steps in the dark in an inert gas atmosphere, under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C., preferably lower than 30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the dyestuff recovery process of the invention, there are no restrictions as to the solvent in which the singlet oxygen quencher is dissolved so long as it dissolves said dyestuff. However, the solvent should preferably be one which does not dissolve said substrate (particularly polycarbonate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Examples of the solvent include alcohols (such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol (PIA), and n-butanol), 1,2-ethanediol, glycerin, cellosolves (such as methyl cellosolve and ethyl cellosolve), and hydroxyketones (such as 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-butanone, 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, and diacetone alcohol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the dyestuff recovery process of the invention, it is desirable that the content of said singlet oxygen quencher in said solvent be from 1 wt % to 10 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With a content less than 1 wt %, the singlet oxygen quencher is poor in action. With a content in excess of 10 wt %, the superfluous singlet oxygen quencher may contaminate the eluate of chromatography for dyestuff separation and purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The content of the singlet oxygen quencher in the solvent for treatment of the dyestuff-containing layer should be from 1 wt % to 10 wt %, preferably from 3 wt % to 10 wt %, more preferably 3 wt % to 7 wt %, so that the dyestuff can be recovered at a rate higher than 50% and in a purity higher than 95%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The singlet oxygen quencher used in the dyestuff recovery process of the invention should preferably be one or more species selected from the group consisting of conjugated polyenes, transition metal complexes, amines including hindered amines (HALS), aminium salts, and iminium slats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The singlet oxygen quencher is exemplified by those compounds represented by chemical formulas 1 to 13 below. Any other compounds may be used so long as they meet the above-mentioned requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Those compounds represented by chemical formula 1 are conjugated polyenes; those compounds represented by chemical formulas 2 to 7 are transition metal complexes or transition metal compounds; those compounds represented by chemical formulas 8 to 10 are hindered amines; those compounds represented by chemical formula 11 are amines; those compounds represented by chemical formula 12 are iminium salts; and those compounds represented by chemical formula 13 are aminium salts.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the dyestuff recovery process of the invention, the fourth step to separate the dyestuff may be carried out by using several solvents which sequentially increase in polarity. A solvent with the highest polarity is used for the final stage of dyestuff recovery in the case where said fourth step employs silica gel chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the solvent used for dyestuff recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned solvent for dyestuff recovery should preferably be freed of oxygen and incorporated with the above-mentioned singlet oxygen quencher prior to its use, for the same reason mentioned above. To be more specific, the removal of oxygen may be accomplished by the introduction of an inert gas into the solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As in the case mentioned above, the content of the singlet oxygen quencher in the solvent for dyestuff recovery should be from 1 wt % to 10 wt %, preferably from 3 wt % to 10 wt %, and more preferably from 3 wt % to 7 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The singlet oxygen quencher to be added to the solvent for dyestuff recovery should preferably be one or more species selected from the group consisting of conjugated polyenes, transition metal complexes, amines including hindered amines, aminium salts, and iminium slats. Their examples include those compounds represented by chemical formulas 1 to 13 given above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The solvent for dyestuff recovery should preferably be one which dissolves said dyestuff but does not dissolve said substrate. This solvent may be the same one as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment to recover a dyestuff from dye-based optical disks according to the dyestuff recovery process of the invention will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing a dye-based optical disk <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consisting of a substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of polycarbonate resin or the like, a dyestuff-containing layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (as a recording layer containing a dyestuff such as cyanine dye), a reflecting film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of gold or aluminum, and a protective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of acrylic resin or the like, which are arranged in the order mentioned. Incidentally, the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has guide grooves (pits), which are not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating the procedure of dyestuff recovery according to the dyestuff recovery process of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> refers to the following explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The process starts with separating a dye-based optical disk into two parts, one consisting of a substrate and a dyestuff-containing layer and the other consisting of a reflecting film and a protective film. This peeling step may be accomplished in an inert gas atmosphere in the dark, or in an aqueous solution(preferably free of oxygen) containing a surface active agent, with or without ultrasonic irradiation. Effective peeling may be accomplished by such preliminary steps as scratching the protective film of the disk or crushing the disk into pieces of adequate size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Scratching may be accomplished by using an edged tool, an electrically heated wire, or a laser beam. There are no specific restrictions on the way of scratching (such as depth and position). It is desirable that scratching be deep enough to reach the dyestuff-containing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> After separation in the first step, the reflecting film and the protective film may be separated from each other for the recovery of gold from the reflecting film and the recovery of acrylic resin from the protective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the second step, the substrate carrying the dyestuff-containing layer, with the reflecting and protective films removed, is immersed in or sprayed with a solution containing the above-mentioned singlet oxygen quencher, so that the dyestuff-containing layer is dissolved. Thus, separation into an insoluble component (or substrate component) and a soluble component (or dyestuff extract component <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the insoluble component is removed by filtration or any other means. The thus obtained dyestuff extract component <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is concentrated by using a rotary evaporator or the like. The concentration step should be carried out under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C., preferably lower than 30&deg; C., in consideration of the efficiency of solvent evaporation and the condition of dyestuff decomposition. In this way there is obtained the dyestuff extract component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Needless to say, the insoluble substrate component (such as polycarbonate resin) is recovered and reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the concentrated dyestuff (or the dyestuff extract component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) undergoes separation and purification by recrystallization or liquid chromatography. An object of recovering a dyestuff in high purity may be achieved by using the latter (alternatively high-performance liquid chromatography). Silica gel chromatography is particularly recommended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Solvents for elution are not specifically restricted. They include such less reactive solvents as aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and esters. More than one solvent should be used in combination so that the resulting mixture has an adequate polarity. Typical examples are ethanol, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For silica gel chromatography, it is desirable to prepare the column from silica gel and a solvent which has previously been freed of oxygen by bubbling with an inert gas. For high-performance liquid chromatography, it is desirable to completely clear the column of oxygen by means of a solvent which has previously been freed of oxygen by bubbling with an inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The elution (separation and extraction) of the dyestuff may be accomplished by using a single solvent from start to finish or by using several polar solvents one after another in order of increasing polarity. (The latter is referred to as gradient method.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the case where the dyestuff-containing layer contains two dyestuffs (dyestuff a and dyestuff b), the dyestuff extract component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> obtained as mentioned above may be divided into four fractions: fraction A (dyestuff decomposition product), fraction B (quencher), fraction C (dyestuff a), and fraction D (dyestuff b), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is from the last two fractions that the two dyestuffs are recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The four fractions (A, B, C, and D) may be obtained in the order mentioned according as the polarity of the solvent increases. This is not always the case, however. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> After sequential elution (separation) by adequately combined solvents, each fraction is concentrated by using a rotary evaporator or the like, preferably under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C., preferably lower than 30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The resulting concentrates (solids) are tested for the identification and purity of dyestuffs by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, UV light and visible light spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, etc. In this way it is possible to efficiently recover from optical disks the dyestuff component in high purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned procedure according to the dyestuff recovery process of the invention permits not only the recovery of dyestuffs but also the separation and extraction (for reuse) of the singlet oxygen quencher incorporated into the solvent (which is referred to as fraction B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned preferred embodiments are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the following examples, which are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> First, dye-based optical disks constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> were prepared in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A polycarbonate substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for CD-R (12 cm in diameter) was spin-coated with a dyestuff solution in diacetone alcohol which contains the following two dyestuffs mixed in a ratio of 1:1, so that a dyestuff-containing layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (recording layer), 0.1 &mgr;m thick, was formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Dyestuff a: benzoindoline-based cyanine dye represented by the structural formula 2 above. (NK-3219 available from Nippon Kanko Shikiso Kenkyusho Co., Ltd.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Dyestuff b: indoline-based cyanine dye represented by the structural formula 3 above. (NK-3383 available from Nippon Kanko Shikiso Kenkyusho Co., Ltd.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> On the dyestuff-containing layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was formed a reflecting film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (0.1 &mgr;m thick) from gold by vapor deposition. This step was followed by spin-coating with a UV-curable acrylic resin, which was subsequently cured by UV irradiation, so as to form a protective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this way there was obtained a dye-based optical disk of write-once type 1 (which will be referred to as disk hereinafter). Incidentally, the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has pits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Dyestuff recovery from the disk was carried out according to the procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The protective film of the disk was scratched with a razor blade in a cross-hatch pattern at intervals of 1 cm. The disk was separated into two parts A and B (A consisting of the dyestuff-containing layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and B consisting of the reflecting film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), in a nitrogen atmosphere in the dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A 5 wt % ethanol solution was prepared by dissolving in ethanol (which had been freed of oxygen by bubbling with nitrogen) a nitrosophenylamine-based singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02 available from Nippon Kanko Shikiso Kenkyusho Co., Ltd.). This solution containing a singlet oxygen quencher is referred to as solvent A hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In this solvent A was immersed the part A (consisting of the dyestuff-containing layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) so as to dissolve the constituent of the dyestuff-containing layer. Thus there were obtained an insoluble component and a soluble component (dyestuff extract component). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> After filtration to remove the insoluble component (originating from the substrate), the soluble component (dyestuff extract component) was concentrated using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For separation and purification, the resulting concentrate underwent silica gel chromatography eluted with a chloroform-ethanol mixed solvent. The column for chromatography was completely freed of oxygen beforehand. Gradient elution was employed in which the polarity of the eluent (solvent) was gradually increased by changing the mixing ratio of chloroform to ethanol from 20:1 to 1:1 by volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The gradient elution gave four fractions. Each fraction was concentrated by using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at a temperature lower than 40&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Solid samples obtained from the four fractions A, B, C, and D were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, UV light and visible light spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. They were identified as shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Fraction A: aromatic compounds (presumably decomposition products of the dyestuffs) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Fraction B: singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Fraction C: dyestuff a (recovery&equals;65%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Fraction D: dyestuff b (recovery&equals;63%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the dyestuffs in fractions C and D were found to have purities higher than 95%. The recoveries of fractions C and D were calculated from their weight in terms of ratio (by weight) to the amount of each dyestuff in the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it was found that part of the singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) in fraction B was reusable. As shown above, this example permits efficient recovery of both dyestuffs a and b in high purity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A solution containing 1 wt % singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) in ethanol was prepared. This solution will be referred to as solvent B hereinafter. Excepting that the solution A was replaced by solution B, the same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated to recover the dyestuff component. The following four fractions A to D were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Fraction A: aromatic compounds (presumably decomposition products of the dyestuffs) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Fraction B: singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Fraction C: dyestuff a (recovery&equals;45%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Fraction D: dyestuff b (recovery&equals;40%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Example 2 that employed solvent B (containing 1 wt % quencher) was comparable to Example 1 in efficient recovery of dyestuffs in high purity although it is slightly poor in the recoveries of dyestuffs in fractions C and D. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A solution containing 10 wt % singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) in diacetone alcohol was prepared. This solution will be referred to as solvent C hereinafter. Excepting that the solution A was replaced by solution C, the same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated to recover the dyestuff component. The following four fractions A to D were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Fraction A: aromatic compounds (presumably decomposition products of the dyestuffs) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Fraction B: singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Fraction C: dyestuff a </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Fraction D: dyestuff b </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Example 3 that employed solvent C (containing 10 wt % quencher) was slightly poor in the recoveries of dyestuffs in fractions C and D as compared with Example 1. In addition, overlapping bands were observed which are presumably due to the entrance of the quencher into each fraction. Nevertheless, Example 3 is capable of efficient recovery of dyestuffs in comparatively high purity in view of the fact that the dyestuffs a and b in fractions C and D have a purity of about 70% or less. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Comparative Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated except that the ethanol solution of quencher was replaced by neat ethanol which had been freed of oxygen by bubbling with nitrogen. The following four fractions A to D were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Fraction A: aromatic compounds (presumably decomposition products of the dyestuffs) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Fraction B: singlet oxygen quencher (Q-02) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Fraction C: dyestuff a (recovery&equals;24%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Fraction D: dyestuff b (recovery&equals;19%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Extraction with the solvent containing no singlet oxygen quencher gave fractions A and B which are similar in composition to those obtained in Example 1. However, it gave fractions C and D resulting in extremely low recoveries of dyestuffs a and b as indicated by analysis and weighing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned Examples demonstrated that dyestuffs poor in light resistance and vulnerable to oxidation and decomposition can be recovered efficiently in high purity by treatment with a solvent containing a singlet oxygen quencher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The dyestuff recovery process of the invention is designed to recover from dyestuff-containing information recording media having at least a dyestuff-containing layer dyestuffs contained in said dyestuff-containing layer by treating said dyestuff-containing layer with a solvent containing a singlet oxygen quencher. The singlet oxygen quencher is reactive more to said dyestuff than to oxygen, so that it protects said dyestuff from photo-oxidative decomposition and state change by oxygen. This leads to efficient recovery of said dyestuff in high purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In addition, the dyestuff recovery solvent of the invention is designed to be used to recover from dyestuff-containing information recording media having at least a dyestuff-containing layer dyestuffs contained in said dyestuff-containing layer. It contains a singlet-oxygen quencher, so that, for the same reason mentioned above, it dissolves said dyestuffs stably in high concentrations while protecting said dyestuffs from decomposition and state change. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for dyeing cellulosic materials with reactive dye by pretreating the fabric with a polycationic polymeric agent which is desirably also polynucleophilic is disclosed. The agent can be a polyquaternary amine material especially a poly(DADMAC) or polyvinylpyridine, particularly one including nucleophilic sites such as primary amino groups, e.g. polyallylamine/DADMAC copolymers and polyvinylpyridines quaternisied with w-aminoalkyl groups. The dyes can react with the nucleophilic centres so dyebath exhaustion can be driven by dye fixation rather than substantivity to the substrate. The need to use of salts to drive substantivity can be obviated and post dyeing washing to remove unreacted/hydrolysed dye is much simplified. Material dyed by the method has the good wash fastness properties of materials dyed using reactive dyes. A wide variety of cellulosic substrates can be dyed including lyocell fibre materials and blend/union materials with polyamides. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This information relates to the dyeing of textiles, and in particular to the dyeing of pre-treated cellulosic textiles using reactive dyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known that cellulosic textiles can be dyed with reactive dyes. Reactive dyes have groups that form covalent bonds with the cellulose molecules. A significant difficulty in using reactive dyes on cellulosic textiles is that reactive dyes are not naturally strongly substantive to cellulose so that large amounts of salts e.g. NaCl, are used to encourage deposition of the dye onto the textile. Even with the use of salt, complete exhaustion of the dyebath is not obtained so that substantial amounts of dye are left in the dyebath, thus yielding an effluent which is both highly coloured and has a high electrolyte loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on our discovery that by using a suitable pretreatment the cellulosic fibres can be modified so that reactive dyes are substantive to the cellulose without electrolyte addition to the dyebath. Further, residual reactive dye and hydrolysed dye (which is often formed because for many reactive dyes on cellulosic substrates, the dyeing is carried out under alkaline conditions) needs to be removed from the fabric after dyeing by often prolonged and complex wash off procedures. Failure to carry out this post-dyeing washing thoroughly generally leads to poor wash fastness and adjacent fabric staining during washing in normal use). This pretreatment can be applied to cotton and similar cellulosic substrates, including regenerated cellulosics such as rayon and lyocell materials, to give well dyed products with excellent wash fastness and good (low) staining of adjacent fabrics in normal washing in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of making a dyed cellulosic fibrous textile material, which includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1 treating the material with a polymeric pretreatment agent having a plurality of cationic centres and desirably also a plurality of nucleophilic centres; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2 dyeing the material with a reactive dye; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3 optionally treating the material with a cationic polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The substrate treated in this invention is described as a fibrous cellulosic textile material. By this we mean that the substrate is cellulosic or contains, typically, from 30 to 100% fibres of, cellulosic material. Typical cellulosic fibre materials which can be included in such fabrics include natural cellulosic fibrous material such as cotton, flax, jute, hemp and ramie, and synthetic or regenerated cellulosic fibrous material such as rayon particularly viscose and acetate rayon and solvent spun materials, particularly where the solvent is N-methylmorpholine oxide (NMMO) which are often referred to as lyocell materials and in particular the lyocell fibre from Courtaulds and the fabrics made from such fibre sold under the Courtaulds trade name &lsquo;Tencel&rsquo;. The cellulosic fibre material can be a blend on more than one type of cellulosic fibre or a blend of fibres of cellulosic fibres with non-cellulosic materials and in particular includes blends of cellulosic fibres, particularly cotton, rayon and, especially, lyocell, fibre with polyester, particularly polyethylene terephthalate polymer or related copolymer, fibre, or with polyamide fibres, including wool, silk and synthetic polyamides such as nylon. The textile can be a woven (including knitted) or non-woven textile, but will usually be a clothing textile material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The polymeric pretreatment agent used in the invention is cationic and such materials are referred to as cationic polymeric pretreatment agents. The cationic polymeric pretreatment agents are polymer including a plurality of cationic centres and are usually made by polymerisation of monomers containing cationic or potentially cationic centres. Desirably the cationic centres are quaternary nitrogen centres which may be aliphatic quaternary ammonium groups or quaternary aromatic nitrogen centres. The quaternary nitrogen centre may be present as such in the polymeric agent or may be present under application conditions or may be generated in situ after application to the textile. Examples of cationic quaternary nitrogen centres which can be present in the polymeric pretreatment agent include: &mdash;N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>(R)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>where each R is an alkyl group particularly a C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkyl e.g. methyl group, although one or more of the R groups may be a longer chain alkyl group e.g. a C<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>alkyl group, or where two of the groups R together with the nitrogen atom bearing them form a heterocyclic ring, particularly a 5 or 6 membered ring, which may include further hetero atoms, such as piperidine, tetrahydropyrrole, piperazine and morpholine rings, which may themselves be further suited as in N-alkyl e.g. methyl, piperazine rings; or one of the R groups may be a group, typically an alkylene group, linking to another, usually nitrogen, site in the polymer or to another polymer chain; or &minus;N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>(R&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>- where the groups R&prime; are as defined for R above and the other bonds directly or indirectly link into the polymer chain optionally via a ring, usually a 5- or 6-membered ring; and aromatic quaternary nitrogen centres such as pyridinium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The degree of cationicity (expressed as cationic centres per units of molecular weight) is generally at least 1 cationic, particularly quaternary nitrogen centre, per 1500 Daltons (D), desirably at least 1 cationic centre per 1000 D, more usually at least 1 cationic centre per 750 D and with the most effective polymers we have tested at least 1 cationic centre per 500 D. The maximum concentration of cationic centres is about 1 per 120 D, desirably not more than about 1 per 150 D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Expressed as cationic centres per monomer residue in the polymer, the polymer typically has at least about 1 cationic centre per 20, more usually at least about 1 cationic centre per 10, and desirably at least about 1 cationic centre per 5, monomer residues in the polymer. For a polymer which is cationic but not nucleophilic the upper limit is typically 1 cationic centre per monomer residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Examples of cationic polymeric pretreatment agents include polymers of diallyidimethylammonium chloride (which polymerises to give a repeat unit including cyclic, 5- and/or 6-membered ring including dimethyl ammonium groups)&mdash;conveniently referred to under the abbreviation poly-DADMAC (diallyidimethylammonium chloride) such as is available under the trade name Matexil FC-ER from ICI Surfactants, quaternised (co-)polymers of vinylpyridines, such as 4-vinylpyridine, copolymers of dimethyl amine and epi-chlorohydrin such as is available under the trade name Fixogene CXF from ICI Surfactants and copolymers of diallyidimethylammonium and diallyl-N-2-hydroxy-3-chloro-propylamine (or its protonated ammonium derivative) and copolymers having repeat units of diallylmethylamine (or its protonated ammonium derivative) and diallyl-N-methyl-N2-hydroxyl-3-chloropropylammonium. The charge balancing anions for the quaternary ammonium groups are typically halide, particularly chloride, ions. These latter two copoplymers are capable of crosslinking or similar reactions involving the chloride substituent on the propyl group and other nitrogen centres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The use of cationic polymeric pretreatment agents has the advantage that they are strongly substantive to the cellulosic fibres, and are thus readily applied to the textiles, and typical reactive dyes are substantive to the treated cellulosic textile material. This can substantially ease application of the dyes to the cellulosic textile material for example reducing or eliminating the need for the use of salts to encourage substantivity and making it possible to operate to high dye solution exhaustion. However, the cationic polymeric pretreatment agents do not generally make the cellulosic textile material more reactive towards the dyestuffs so that the conditions for reaction between the cellulose and the dyestuff will be those typically used for the respective reactive dyes on cellulose and there remains the need for thorough washing out of the dyed fabric to remove unreacted and/or hydrolysed reactive dye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The polymeric pretreatment agent desirably has both a plurality of cationic centres and a plurality of nucleophilic centres and such materials are known as cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents. Typically, cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents will be polymers of monomers containing at least one cationic (or potentially cationic) centre and containing a nucleophilic group. The cationic centre and nucleophilic group can be in the same or different monomer units. Yet other monomers can be included e.g. substantially inert monomers to regulate the cationicity and/or nucleophilicity of the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The nucleophilic centres can be strongly nucleophilic groups as such or groups that are relatively weak nucleophilic centres in themselves, but are promoted by other groups on the pretreatment agent. The nucleophilic centres are desirably relatively strong nucleophiles that react readily with the reactive dye. As is described later, the inclusion of nucleophilic centres enable the use of less vigorous conditions for dyeing so the nucleophilic centres are desirably relatively strong nucleophiles under neutral or relatively mildly alkaline aqueous conditions e.g. from pH 6 to 9 and particularly from 6 to 7.5. Examples of relatively strong nucleophilic centres include primary amino groups, especially primary aliphatic amino groups as these are more reactive than aromatic primary amino groups, secondary aliphatic amino groups and thiol groups. Examples of relatively weak nucleophilic centres that can be promoted by other groups on the pretreatment agent include activated hydroxyl groups, especially primary aliphatic hydroxyl groups, beta to a quaternary ammonium group which activates the hydroxyl group e.g. 2-hydroxyethyl(quaternary)ammonium groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The cationicity of the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents is typically similar to that of the cationic polymeric pretreatment agents as described above. However, the maximum cationicity is generally somewhat lower as the inclusion of nucleophilic centres increases the molecular weight per cationic centre. The degree of cationicity (expressed as cationic centres per units of molecular weight) is generally at least 1 cationic, particularly quaternary nitrogen centre, per 1500 D, desirably at least 1 cationic centre per 1000 D, more usually at least 1 cationic centre per 750 D and with the most effective polymers we have tested at least 1 cationic centre per 500 D. The maximum concentration of cationic centres is typically about 1 per 180 D more usually about 1 per 200 D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Expressed as cationic centres per monomer residue in the polymer, the polymer typically has at least about 1 cationic centre per 20, more usually at least about 1 cationic centre per 10, and desirably at least about 1 cationic centre per 5, monomer residues in the polymer. For a polymer which is cationic but not nucleophilic the practical upper limit is typically 1 cationic centre per monomer residue, but more usually the cationicity will be lower than this e.g. 3 cationic centres per 4 monomer residues as in quaternised vinyl pyridines and 1 cationic centre per 2 monomer residues as in a polymer made from equal molar proportions of cationic and nucleophilic monomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The concentration of nucleophilic centres in the polymer (expressed as nucleophilic centres per units of molecular weight) is generally at least 1 nucleophilic centres per 1500 D, desirably at least 1 per 1000 D, more usually at least 1 per 750D and with the most effective polymers we have tested at least 1 per 500 D. The maximum concentration of nucleophilic centres is about 1 per 60 D, more usually about 1 per 70 D and most usually about 1 per 100 D. Expressed as nucleophilic centres per monomer residue in the polymer, the polymer typically has at least about 1 nucleophilic centres per 20, more usually at least about 1 per 10, and desirably at least about 1 per 5, monomer residues in the polymer. The practical upper limit is typically 1 nucleophilic centres per monomer residue e.g. where the monomer residues carry both nucleophilic and cationic centres, but more usually as the polymer will often carry the cationic and nucleophilic centres on residues of different monomers, in this case, the maximum number of nucleophilic centres will be lower than this e.g. 9, and more usually 8, nucleophilic centres per 10 monomer residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The use of cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents shares the advantages of cationic polymeric pretreatment agents that they are strongly substantive to the cellulosic fibres, and are thus readily applied to the cellulosic textile material. In addition, the presence of the nucleophilic centres in these pretreatment agents makes the reaction between the treated cellulosic textile material and the reactive dyestuffs (believed to be between the nucleophilic centres on the pretreatment agent and the reactive dyestuff) possible under milder conditions than is normally possible for most reactive dyes on cellulosic substrates. Indeed, where the nucleophilic centres are themselves highly reactive towards the reactive dyes, especially where the nucleophilic centres are or include aliphatic primary amino groups, the ease of reaction between the dye and the treated cellulosic textile material can drive the exhaustion of the dye onto the fabric, even where the reactive dye is itself not strongly substantive to the treated cellulosic textile material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The cationic polymeric pretreatment agents and cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents used in this invention typically have molecular weighs of from 5 to 50 kD (klaoDaltons) and more desirably from 10 to 30 kD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents can be made from a variety of monomeric units. Cationic sites can be provided by ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing cationic centres e.g. quaternary nitrogen atoms, or centres that can be converted into quaternary nitrogen atoms e.g. primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups that can be quaternised, or halogen atoms that can be replaced (directly or indirectly) with quaternary nitrogen atoms. Nucleophilic sites can be provided by ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing nucleophilic centres e.g. particularly primary or secondary amino groups, thiol groups or activated hydroxyl groups, especially aliphatic hydroxyl groups beta to a quaternary ammonium group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Examples of cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents include copolymers of DADMAC and ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a primary amino group such as allylamine (3-aminoprop-1-ene); poly(N-methyl-N-(aminoalkyl)diallylammonium, where the aminoalkyl group is e.g. 2-aminoethyl or 3-aminopropyl; polymers of vinylpyridine e.g. 4-vinylpyridine, quaternised with groups, particularly alkyl groups, containing a primary amino group e.g. quaternised with a 2-aminoethyl group, in effect copolymers of the vinylpyridine and the quaternised vinylpyridine; and copolymers having repeat units of diallylmethylamine (or its protonated ammonium derivative) and diallyl-2-hydroxyl-3-chloropropyl amine (or its protonated ammonium derivative). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Quaternisation of vinylpyridines such as 4-vinylpyridine can be carried out using conventional techniques to an extent of about 75% of the available aromatic nitrogens. Quatemisation can be with mixed groups e.g. alkyl groups and aminoalkyl groups, to vary the ratio of cationic to nucleophilic sites. However, unless the quaternising agent has a plurality of nucleophilic sites, and as one cationic site is generated for each quaternisation reaction, the ratio of cationic to nucleophilic sites will not generally be greater than 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a quaternary nitrogen atom e.g. DADMAC, and ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a primary amino group e.g. allylamine, can be made with varying ratios of cationic to nucleophilic sites by varying the proportions of the starting monomers. In such copolymers we have found that the performance is generally better where the ratio of nucleophilic to cationic centres is at least 1 to 1 and particularly from 1 to 1 to 5 to 1, e.g. about 3 to 1. Especially with such materials we have observed that the exhaustion of the dye onto the cellulosic textile material seems to be driven by fixation of the dye (presumably mainly to the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent) so there is only relatively little dye on the fibre in unreacted form. This seems to simplify post dyeing washing even further. Copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a quaternary nitrogen atom and ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a primary amino group, in particular copolymers of allylamine and DADMAC and similar polymers are highly desirable pretreatment agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The pretreatment of the fabric with the polymeric pretreatment agent can be carried out by immersing the fabric in an aqueous solution or dispersion of the pretreatment agent at temperatures of up to about 130&deg; C. e.g. up to about 100&deg; C., particularly from 20 to 80&deg; C., for a period of up to 2 hours, particularly from 15 minutes to 1 hour, e.g. from 20 to 30 minutes. Temperatures of about 40&deg; are particularly appropriate for cotton and similar natural cellulosic materials although higher temperatures may be used. Temperatures of about 60 to about 80&deg; C. are particularly appropriate for synthetic cellulosic materials such as rayon and lyocell materials, because the polymer is generally more crystalline than in natural cellulosic materials, although again higher temperatures may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The concentration of the pretreatment agent in the treatment bath is desirably from 0.1 to 3%, particularly 0.25 to 2% and especially from 0.5 to 1%, by weight of 100% active pretreatment agent based on the dry weight of the fabric being pretreated. (Note&mdash;the pretreatment agents are typically supplied as 30 to 35% active aqueous solutions and this will be taken into account in determining the amount of the particular product used.) The liquor ratio (the ratio of the treatment/dye solution used to dry cloth weight) for pretreatment is typically from 5 to 25 desirably about 10. The pretreatment solution is typically at about neutral pH typically from 6 to about 8. More acidic treatment solutions may be appropriate when needed to ensure that the cationic groups in the pretreatment agent are cationic e.g. when they are amino groups that are &lsquo;quaternised&rsquo; with protons from an acid medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pretreatment can also be carried out by padding at ambient temperature using concentrations and pH values similar to those described above to give pick up typically about 70 to 150% by weight based on the dry fibre weight with padding, followed by drying typically at from about 80 to about 150&deg; C., more usually from about 80 to about 120&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Reactive dyes are dyes which include a reactive centre which will react with a nucleophilic group (conventionally on the material of the textile being dyed) to form a covalent bond which strongly bonds the dye to the fibre. The reactive centre is typically an electronic centre, often associated with a good leaving group, and is often an activated carbon atom having a leaving group e.g. a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, bonded to it, or a carbon atom in an activated double bond. Examples include triazine residues (2,4,6-trihalo-sym-triazinyl) carrying leaving groups such as halogen e.g. chlorine and/or fluorine, substituents, or other leaving groups such as N-linked nicotinic acid, halogen e.g. chlorine and/or fluorine, substituted pyrimidine groups, and activated ethylenic double bonds such as vinyl sulphone groups as in &bgr;-sulphatovinyl sulphone groups, and acrylic groups such as acrylamido groups particularly halogen e.g. bromine, substituted acrylamido groups. Reactive dyestuffs can include more than one such group and may have more than one such type of group. </paragraph>

Reactive premetallized dyes such as 2:1 symmetrical reactive acid dyes including an acrylamido group: &mdash;NH.C(O)CH&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, such as Cl Reactive Red 169. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the formulae of these dyestuffs given above the groups labelled &ldquo;Dye&rdquo; are the chromophoric dye residues, which typically include sulphonate or other anionic centres. The reactive groups and the groups linking them to the Dye groups are typically chosen so that they interfere little with the colour produced by the dye chromophore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The conditions of dyeing will depend on the nature of the reactive dye and of the pretreatment applied to the cellulosic textile material. Where the pretreatment agent is a cationic polymeric pretreatment agent the dyeing conditions will be those typically used for the respective reactive dyes on cellulose. In this case, where the reactive group in the dye is a halotriazine residue, a halopyrimidine residue or a vinyl sulphone group, the dyeing conditions will typically be strongly alkaline (pH typically 10.8 to 11.2) and the dyeing temperature typically 60&deg; C. or higher. However, where the reactive group in the dye is a N-linked nicotinic acid substituted triazine residue, the dyeing conditions may be near neutral. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Where the pretreatment agent is a cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent the dyeing will typically be carried out at near neutral pH e.g. from about 6 to about 8, although more alkaline conditions can be used. The temperature will be appropriate for the reactive dye type and will typically be from about 60&deg; C. to about 130&deg; C. e.g. about 60&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C. The use of conditions near neutral pH has the major advantage that hydrolysis of the reactive dye is kept to a minimum. In practice we have been able to operate with substantially no hydrolysis of the reactive dye. The dyebath will typically contain no significant amount of electrolyte as it is not needed to drive substantivity to the pretreated cellulosic textile material. Thus, typically, the dyebath is an aqueous solution of the dye and after dyeing contains residual reactive dye with no significant amount of hydrolysed dye or electrolyte and can thus readily be re-used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The amount of dye used, the concentration of dye in the dyebath and the amount applied to the textile, will depend on the dye itself and the desired intensity of dyeing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, after dyeing cellulosic textile material with reactive dyes, it is necessary to remove any unbound e.g. unreacted or hydrolysed, reactive dye from the cellulosic textile material. In this invention, where the pretreatment is done using a cationic polymeric pretreatment agent, this post-dyeing washing will generally need to be conventional and thorough. Indeed, as the dyes may be substantive to the treated cellulosic textile material, it may need to be more thorough than in conventional systems. However, where the pretreatment is done using a cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent, we have found that much milder post-dyeing washing conditions can be used, especially where the ability of the present method to successfully use dyes that are weakly substantive to the treated cellulosic textile material is exploited so that any remaining dye can be readily removed by washing. In this case, especially, the need for post-dyeing washing is much less than with conventional reactive dyes on cellulosic textile materials. Indeed, the post-dyeing washing can be a relatively simple and short rinse e.g. for 10 to 30, especially 15 to 20, minutes in water or a relatively mildly alkaline e.g. pH 7 to 10.5, aqueous solution which may include a detergent at moderate temperatures e.g. 50 to 100&deg; C., especially 70 to 85&deg; C. This mild post-dyeing washing contrasts strongly with typical post dyeing washing in conventional reactive dyeing processes on cellulosic textile materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After dyeing the cellulosic textile material can be further treated with a cationic polymer. The cationic polymer used for such a post treatment will generally be of the same type as the cationic polymeric pretreatment agents or the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents as described above, referred to in this context as cationic polymeric post-treatment agents. Similarly, the treatment conditions, concentrations and amounts are within the general and specific ranges set out above for the cationic polymeric pretreatment agents. The cationic polymeric post-treatment agents are substantive to the cellulosic textile material and we believe that they form a coating or layer over the dye on the cellulosic textile material (whether bound chemically to the cellulosic textile material or to the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent or unbound) and this can further improve the wash fastness of the dyeing and may reduce any tendency of the reactive dye to migrate in washing onto other co-washed materials. The treatment with cationic polymeric post-treatment agents will typically be carried out after post-dyeing washing to avoid trapping unreacted or hydrolysed dye on the cellulosic textile material. If a cationic polymeric post-treatment agent including a group reactive to other parts of the cationic polymeric post-treatment agents or to the cationic polymeric pretreatment agent or the cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent is used, it is possible to generate higher molecular weight species by linking, crosslinling and polymerisation. This may further enhance the wash fastness of the dyed fabric. An example of such reactive cationic polymeric post-treatment agents are copolymers having repeat units of diallymethylamine (or its protonated ammonium derivative) and diallyl-2-hydroxyl-3-chloropropyl amine (or its protonated ammonium derivative). However, where optimised pretreatment and dyeing according to the invention is used, aftertreatment is not needed to improve the wash fastness of the dyeing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Using the pretreatment step according to the invention, we have successfully obtained good dyed products having excellent wash fastness and staining of adjacent fabrics in washing in normal use as compared with conventional reactive dyed cellulosic textile materials. As is mentioned above, where the pretreatment step uses a cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agents, the advantages over conventional reactive dyeing systems on cellulosic textile materials can include good exhaustion onto the fabric without having to use salts to drive exhaustion, relatively mild dyeing and fixing conditions for a wide range of reactive dyes, the ability to use reactive dyes that are not conventionally usable on cellulosic materials such as the haloacrylamide type reactive dyes, and a much reduced need for post dyeing washing to remove unreacted/hydrolysed dyes. Where the pretreatment step uses a cationic polymeric pretreatment agent the dyeing and fixing steps are carried out under broadly conventional conditions for reactive dyes on cellulosic textile materials and there will generally be a greater need for post dyeing washing than is possible where the pretreatment step uses a cationic nucleophilic polymeric pretreatment agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The improved dyeing of reactive dyes to cellulosic textile materials obtained in the present invention, makes it possible to dye mixed or blended fabrics much more simply with a wide range of reactive dyestuffs that is possible with conventional processes. The choice of a reactive dye may be constrained by the selection of dyes that are reactive towards the other fibre materials of the blend, but we do not expect this to be a problem to the skilled person. In particular, the pretreatment enables union fabrics of cellulosic fibres, particularly cotton, rayon, and lyocell materials, with polyamide fibres such as wool, silk and nylon to be dyed relatively easily and uniformly. Thus, wool/cotton union fabrics can be uniformly dyed according to the invention using e.g. haloacrylamide, halopyrimidine and vinyl sulphone type reactive dyes. This possibility forms a specific aspect of the invention which accordingly includes a method of dyeing a blend or union fabric containing cellulosic fibres, particularly of cotton, rayon, or lyocell, and polyamide fibres particularly of wool, silk or nylon, which includes the steps of: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> On lyocell materials e.g. &lsquo;Tencel&rsquo; fabrics made using lyocell fibre made by Courtaulds) the pretreatment was carried out by immersing samples of the &lsquo;Tencel&rsquo; fabric (190 g.m<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>) in an aqueous solution of the pretreatment agent at 2% (of pretreatment agent as supplied) on the dry fabric weight, and further containing 1 g.l<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, at a liquor ratio L:R of 10:1, at 60&deg; C. for 30 minutes.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the wool/cotton blend (as used in Example 12), the pretreatment was carried out by immersing samples of the fabrics in an aqueous solution of the pretreatment agent at 2% (of pretreatment agent as supplied) on the dry fabric weight at a liquor ratio L:R of 10:1, at 50&deg; C. for 30 minutes at a pH of about 7. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Wet pretreated cotton (either from the pretreatment step or previously pretreated material dried and then rewetted with water) was placed in dyebath containing 2% dye (as supplied) on the dry fibre weight at room temperature. The temperature was raised to the desired dyeing temperature (usually at the boil, nominally 98&deg; C.) and was held at this temperature for 60 minutes. The dyebath itself was either water (giving a pH of about 6) or buffered at pH 7.4 with a mixed phosphate buffer (very similar results were obtained). The dyeing temperatures varied with the reactive dye type used as is discussed in the Examples. After dyeing the cotton was rinsed in cold running water and dried. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> was tested using the ISOC06/C2 (60&deg; C.) wash test to assess the wash fastness of the dyed samples.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Procion H-EXL type dyes: Procion Blue HEXL, Procion Yellow H-EXL, Procion Crimson H-EXL, Procion Red HE-3B. These are bis-monochlorotriazine dyes and are the most popular and widespread range of reactive dyes for cotton and other cellulosic fibres and their blends. For these dyes the conventional dyeing temperature is about 80&deg; C. at alkaline pH, typically pH 10.8 to 11.2, in this Example the dyeing temperature was 98&deg; C. and the pH 7.4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The dyeings produced were level, and gave good shades, although having a colour strength lower than standard dyeings on cotton with these dyes; and showing a slight shade change. The fastness of the dyeings on the pretreated cotton was good, much better than for non-washed off standard dyeings, even with a simple rinse as the post dyeing wash. The simple wash off did not give as good a wash fastness result as for (conventionally) fully washed off standard dyeings, but a wash-off in hot water or hot carbonate solution improved the fastness of the pretreated dyeings further. Interestingly those samples that had been pretreated with PT2 had higher colour strength than those pretreated with PT1. This is perhaps surprising given that PT1 has a higher cationic content. The implication is that the fixation of the dye is driving exhaustion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Procion MX type: Procion Blue MX-G, Procion Yellow MX-4G, Procion Red MX-8B. These are low temperature, high reactive dichlorotriazine dyes, normally applied at 30&deg; C. at pH&gt;11, although various methods have been suggested including a lower pH (ca 10) higher temperature (80&deg; C.) procedure. They are typically small lower substantivity dyes that require up to 90 g.l<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>of electrolyte sequentially added to the dyebath to drive exhaustion of the dye onto the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this Example they were used dye pretreated cotton at dyeing temperatures of 40 and 98&deg; C. at pH 7.4. Slightly higher colour strengths and fastness were obtained at the higher dyeing temperature, although the fastness was very good for all the dyeings. This compares favourably with the standard dyeings: with only a water rinse the fastness of Blue MX-G is particularly poor. There was only a slight change in shade and brightness. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Procion P type dyes: Procion Yellow P-3R, Procion Red P<highlight><bold>-4</bold></highlight>BN, Procion Navy P-2R, Procion Scarlet P-2R. Procion Blue P-3R, Procion Turquoise P-A, Procion Black P-2R, Procion Orange P-2R. These are mono-monochlorotriazine dyes that inherently low substantivity and are designed to be used for printing and are not used for conventional long-liquor exhaust dyeing processes. In this Example, dyeings were produced using Procion P dyes at 98&deg; C. on PT2 pretreated cotton. No comparative standard dyeings could be prepared, but comparison with the samples in the dye supplier&apos;s pattern card showed that the shades were comparable, even though they were a little flat and less bright For those samples that were tested the fastness was excellent, even with just a cold water rinse following dyeing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An interesting comparison can be drawn between dyeings made using Cl Reactive Red 3:1 and Cl Reactive Red 120. Molecularly, Red 3:1 is in effect &ldquo;half&rdquo; Red 120. As both dyes are based on the same chromophore, the shades produced should be the same. However, we found differences between the respective dyeings. Those produced with Red 3:1 suffered less shade change and possessed excellent fastness, following the simple cold water rinse after dyeing. The conclusion from this is that smaller less substantive dyes can be used in the method of this invention (as shown with Procion MX dyes above), to produce satisfactory dyeings without electrolyte or alkali. It also confirms that exhaustion is being driven by fixation of the dye onto the pretreated textile. Further, the smaller less substantive dyes can be washed off much more easily leading to excellent fastness. The shade change imparted to the smaller dyes is smaller, presumably due to a slightly different packing arrangement of the less substantive dyes in the fibre. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Remazol type dyes: Remazol Red RR, Remazol Yellow RR, Remazol Blue RR, Remazol Black B. These are an important class of reactive dyes, second only to the triazine based dyes. They are normally applied at a dyeing temperature of 60&deg; C. at a pH&gt;11. The RR dyes are the latest products in the range and Black B is the biggest selling reactive dye in the world. In this Example the dyes were applied at a dyeing temperature of 98&deg; C. and for Black B also at 60&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The results were similar to those obtained with Procion H-EXL type dyes in that the dyeings produced were level and deep, though of slightly lower colour strength than their conventionally applied counterparts, with a slight during of the shade. The fastness of the preteated sample dyed with Black B was excellent even with only a cold water rinse following dyeing. The slight shade change imparted by the pretreatment was less noticeable for the darker colour. There was a slight difference in the dyeings at the two temperatures, for Black B; the higher temperature application resulted in slightly higher colour strength and visually improved fastness. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Lanasol type dyes: Lanasol Yellow 4G, Lanasol Blue 3G, Lanasol Red 6G. The Lanasol range of reactive dyes, is a small but successful range aimed specifically at wool dyeing. Conventionally, they are not used for cotton as they have virtually no substantivity towards cellulosic fibres. They can be applied to wool at 80, 98 or 105&deg; C., pH 4-6, without suffering dye hydrolysis. In this Example, they were applied at 2% omf to PT2 pretreated cotton at 98&deg; C. The dyeings produced were excellent in terms of depth of shade and brightness. The fastness was also very good to excellent; a rinse in water at 70&deg; C. or using a 1 g.l<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>aqueous Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>solution, was required to maximise the fastness of Blue 3G and Red 6G. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Drimarene/Drimalan type dyes: Drimalan Blue FB, Drimalan Brilliant Red FB, Drimalan Yellow F-3RL - Drimarene and Drimalan dyes are sold for cellulose and wool reactive dyeing respectively. Essentially they are the same chemically, based on chlorodifluoropyrimidine reactive groups (some are trichloropyrimidines of slightly lower reactivity). These dyes are intermediate in reactivity to dichloro- and monochlorotriazine types. They are applied to cotton at temperatures above 60&deg; C. at pH&gt;11. In this Example Drimalan Blue FB was applied to PT1 pretreated cotton at 60&deg; C. and all three Drimalan type dyes to PT2 pretreated cotton at 98&deg; C. The dyeings produced were level and of good colour strength with excellent fastness. </paragraph>

Kayacelon Reacts are nicotinic acid derivatives of monochlorotriazine dyes. Their main advantage over conventional cellulosic reactive dyes is that they are neutral fixing, being conventionally applied with electrolyte, pH 7.4 buffer (or at other pH&apos;s in the range 6 to 8) at 98&deg; C. In this Example, the dyes were applied at the boil to PT2 pretreated cotton. The dyeings produced were level, of similar colour strength to the standards, although there was a shade change. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Sumifix Supra type dyes: Yoracron Yellow BF-3R, Yoracron Red BF-3B, Yoracron Blue BF-R. These dyes are hetro-bifunctional reactive dyes; effectively dichlorotriazine dyes derivatised with a vinyl sulphone precursor. They contain mono-vinylsulphone and monochloroine reactive groups and can be applied at temperatures of 60&deg; C. and above at a typical pH&gt;11. In this Example, the dyes were applied at 98&deg; C. to PT2 pretreated cotton. The shades produced were deep and level, but with a slight hue change and flattening compared to the standard dyeings. </paragraph>

Deep level dyeings were produced, although they were duller, flatter and less bright than the standard dyeing. The fastness was very good, even with only a cold water rinse, indicating that reaction had occurred between the dye and the polymer. </paragraph>

The dyeings produced were deep and level with excellent fastness. The dye itself when applied conventionally is an orange shade of yellow.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The data show the effect of the pretreatment&mdash;in samples without pretreatment the wool portion dyed successfully, whilst the lyocell only stained and the resultant dyeings were dearly mottled; the samples that had been pretreated were coloured far more uniformly and to a deeper depth. The Wash Fastness ratings of the dyeings were good, but were measured on dyeings that had not been washed off after dyeing. A wash off e.g. with aqueous NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(5 g.l<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) at 80 to 85&deg; C., would improve the wash fastness to excellent. The appearance of reduced numerical Fastness ratings for the pretreated samples arises from the much greater colour depth achieved on the cellulosic portion of the blend in these samples. (It is well known that pre-metallized dyes possess high fastness on wool, as can be seen from the data on the non-pretreated sample fastness data in the Table, in which only the wool portion was dyed.) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The dyeings of Example 12 on fibre blend fabrics were extended to other fabrics and other dyes. Fibre blend fabrics were made up with the following materials: velour (nylon/cotton), cotton/silk, linen/silk and hemp/cotton/wool. The fabrics were pretreated with PT1 at described above and samples were then dyed with Lanasol Red 6G, Lanasol Yellow 4G and Lanasol Blue 3G. The dyeing conditions were that the temperature was raised to 98&deg; C. at a rate of 2&deg; C.min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and held at 98&deg; C. for 60 minutes and the dyeings were washed off with aqueous NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(5 g.l<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) at 80 to 85&deg; C., rinsed and dried. The pretreated fabrics dyed to give uniform dyeings of a deeper shade than non-pretreated controls. For the first three mixed fibre fabrics, the fibre blends were intimate enough that the control dyeings looked uniform, but the dyeings on the pretreated fabrics were of a much deeper shade. For the hemp/cotton/wool mixed fabric, the control dyeing looked mottled, whereas the dyeings on the pretreated fabric were uniform and of a much deeper shade. Wash Fastness testing gave similar results to those on viscose/wool and lyocell/wool mixtures described in Example 12. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to substrate cleaning apparatuses and, more specifically to a cleaning apparatus adapted to efficiently and stably provide automatic removal of foreign matters adhering to the surface of a liquid crystal panel, such as cullets and sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing a liquid crystal panel, two glass plates are bonded, the bonded glass plates are cut to have a prescribed size, a liquid crystal is transferred between the bonded and cut glass plates, and deflection plates are bonded on both surfaces of the bonded glass plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the process of manufacturing a liquid crystal panel, when cutting the bonded glass plates to have a prescribed size, cullets (powder or small fragments of glass) produced by the cutting step may stick (in a solid state) to the surface of the glass plate, or a sealant may stick to the glass surface around a sealant transferring portion when sealing the sealant transferring portion after the liquid crystal is transferred between two glass plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because of such foreign matters, i.e., cullets and sealing resin, sticking to the surface of the glass plates in the manufacturing process of the liquid crystal panel, the next step of bonding deflection plates would not be properly performed. Thus, these foreign matters have to be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a conventional method of removing the above mentioned foreign matters, a liquid crystal panel placed in water is set on a cleaning stage that is sprinkled with water, and a cleaning tool provided with a polishing sheet is soaked with water. The cleaning tool is manually held for manual polishing of the liquid crystal panel set on the cleaning stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> After the cleaning step, the liquid crystal panel is passed through a brush rotating in a cleaning tank that is sprinkled with water by a cleaning apparatus. In this way, dusts, water scale and so on that are relatively weakly adhering to the surface of the liquid crystal panel are removed. Thereafter, the liquid crystal panel is dried out after being passed through an air knife. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> After the liquid crystal panel is passed through the cleaning apparatus, the surface thereof is visually inspected, and remaining foreign matters are removed by a cutter or a cloth soaked with a solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Methods of removing foreign matters on the panel surface include a cutter blade rotation method and sheet-rotation polishing method, in addition to manual cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the cutter blade rotation method, at least two blades are provided, which are subjected to rotation and revolution and brought into contact with the liquid crystal panel so as to scrape off the foreign matters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the sheet-rotation polishing method, a stage provided with a sheet is rotated, and an object to be cleaned is brought into contact with the stage from above, for polishing on the rotating stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The feeding and rotation of a polishing tape allow the object to be constantly kept in contact with a new portion of polishing tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, the above described conventional methods of cleaning the liquid crystal panel, including manual cleaning, cutter rotation method and sheet rotation method, suffer from the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The manual cleaning is accompanied by a considerable variation in workability and considerable loss time. In addition, as liquid crystal panels increase in size, instability in removing foreign matters become conspicuous and a loss time increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the cutter rotation method, scratches are likely to be caused over the surface of the object. In addition, there is a variation in cleaning capability depending on a precision associated with, e.g., surface undulation of the object and the like, whereby a stable removing effect cannot be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the sheet-rotation polishing method, the size of an object is limited. Thus, it is difficult to increase the size of the object, and a sheet consumption is extremely high. In addition, pressure control is difficult during polishing, polishing unevenness is likely to be caused, and foreign matters adhering to the sheet may cause scratches. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> One object of the present invention is to provide a substrate cleaning apparatus capable of enhancing operation efficiency with reduced operation time for removal of foreign matters, stably removing foreign matters, providing a high-quality substrate without causing a problem of foreign matters, and cleaning a greater-sized substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention is adapted to remove foreign matters on a substrate surface and is provided with a sheet, roll, and rotating unit. The sheet is arranged to be in contact with the substrate surface. The sheet is wound on the roll. The rotating unit rotates the rolls wound with the sheet with respect to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention automatically rotates the sheet by the rotating unit for cleaning the substrate surface. Thus, unlike the conventional manual cleaning, the foreign matters can be removed with less loss time and operation time, efficiency of the removal operation is enhanced, more stable cleaning is provided, and the foreign matters can be reliably removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, the rolls enable automatic feeding of the sheet. Thus, cleaning can always be performed with a new portion of sheet, whereby an operation loss would not be caused in feeding the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the above described substrate cleaning apparatus, preferably, the sheet is adapted to be brought into line contact with the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the sheet in line contact with the substrate surface allows the foreign matters on the substrate surface to be scraped off the substrate surface, and the foreign matters would not be caught between the sheet and substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the substrate cleaning apparatus, preferably, a sheet supporting member is further provided which is in line contact with the sheet surface opposite the substrate. The sheet supporting member is rotatively supported to incline a portion that is in line contact with the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the sheet supporting member allows the sheet to be rotated closely in line contact with the substrate surface even if the substrate surface is inclined. Thus, the substrate and sheet are reliably and stably kept in contact during rotation, avoiding the problem of precision or undulation of the substrate surface. Further, cleaning efficiency is enhanced, the foreign matters would not be caught between the liquid crystal panel and sheet or drawn over the surface, scratches would not be caused over the substrate surface, and re-adhesion of the foreign matters to the substrate surface is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the substrate cleaning apparatus, preferably, a pressure adjusting unit for measuring a pressure applied to press the sheet against the substrate and adjusting the pressure is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Thus, the sheet can be pressed against the substrate surface with an appropriate and stable pressure, whereby cleaning effect is enhanced and cleaning capability is stabilized. In addition, cell gap unevenness over the substrate is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the substrate cleaning apparatus, preferably, the substrate is a liquid crystal panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described above, the substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention is particularly suitable for cleaning the surface of the liquid crystal panel.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> rotating unit A is adapted to clean the surface of a liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> set on a stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Rotating unit A mainly includes a motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, load cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, belt <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, water-scattering preventing cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, sprinkling nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a pair of sheet rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and mechanism <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for automatically feeding sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is arranged to apply a driving force to rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via belt <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. With belt <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> form <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> a rotating unit. Alternatively, a gear may be provided at the rotation shaft and driven by a motor. Rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via load cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Load cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used for measuring a pressure applied to press the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The pressure is appropriately adjusted by cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on the measurement value. Examples of another pressing methods include directly connecting a motor to a Z shaft of the rotating unit for pressure application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A pair of cylinder-like sheet rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are rotatively supported by rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. One end of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is wound on one sheet roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the other end of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is adapted to be wound on the other sheet roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in line contact with polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and supported by swing mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, swing mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supported rotatively about a bearing shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the C direction (clockwise) and the D direction (counterclockwise), as indicated by arrows. The rotation of sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the portion that is in line contact with polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to be inclined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, water-scattering preventing cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is supported by rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and provided with sprinkling nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> used for sprinkling water during the cleaning operation. Water-scattering preventing cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves to prevent water sprinkled by sprinkling nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from scattering about. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Provided at a portion where sheet roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is fixed is a projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be opposite projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. These projections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> form mechanism <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for automatically feeding the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Now, a moving mechanism of the rotating unit will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, rotating unit A is made movable in the Z shaft direction <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by a motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a ball screw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> mounted to a frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Rotating unit A is made movable by the motor and ball screw also in the X axis direction <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and Y axis direction <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as it is movable in the Z shaft direction.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, an operation of cleaning a liquid crystal panel with use of the cleaning apparatus of the present embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, by rotating motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a constant speed, rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is connected to the driving shaft of motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rotates by belt <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. With the rotation of rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a pair of sheet rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and so on rotate in the direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Upon start of the rotation, nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> starts sprinkling water. At the time, water-scattering preventing cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> prevents sprinkled water from scattering about. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring mainly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, rotating unit A, which is in a rotating operation at a constant speed, is lowered in the Z shaft direction <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and ball screw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Then, rotating unit A stops when it arrives at a position where polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not brought in contact with liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> set on stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring mainly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lowers rotation shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via load cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, whereby polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of rotating unit A that is in the rotating operation, is pressed against liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an appropriate pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> With polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> being in contact with the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the appropriate pressure, rotating unit A moves in the X axis direction <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and Y axis direction <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to leave a cleaning trace <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) over liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this way, the entire surface is cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring mainly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, after cleaning, motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and ball screw <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> elevate rotating unit A in the Z shaft direction <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and water sprinkling and rotation of rotating unit A stop. Rotating unit A returns to its original position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By repeating this operation, several liquid crystal panels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are automatically cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Note that in the operation of automatically feeding sheet, first of all, projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is elevated by cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, brought into contact with projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and directly elevates projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, e.g., by several millimeters, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The elevation of projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> causes rotation of sheet roll <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is fixed to projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereby polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is rolled up by a prescribed amount. This ensures that a new portion of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is always used for cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, the quality, specification, and cleaning conditions of the polishing sheet according to the present embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a base material of Tetron taffeta polyester which is coated with 7 &mgr;m of abrasive white alumina particles through an adhesive of a polyurethane-based synthetic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An abrasive may be applied to the fed sheet during operation of the apparatus for cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the above described cleaning operation, rotation control of motor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> maintains the rotation speed of rotating unit A, e.g., at 400-500 rpm, during cleaning operation of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A contact surface pressure (a pressure applied to liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with respect to liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is controllably maintained, e.g., at 0.1-0.2MPa to enable stable cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The material of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and conditions for the cleaning operation are appropriately selected for cleaning liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that at least 99% of cutlets or foreign matters adhering to the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be removed. Thus, cleaning can be performed without affecting the quality of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example, without causing polishing unevenness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, rotating unit A is automatically rotated to clean the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, unlike the conventional manual cleaning, efficiency and stability of the removal operation can be enhanced with reduced loss time and operation time, whereby foreign matters can be reliably removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition, a pair of rolls <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> enable automatic feeding of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus, a new portion of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is always used for cleaning, and an operation loss associated with the feeding of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> would not be caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Moreover, sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes rotation of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in line contact with the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, foreign matters on the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are caught and scraped off liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, foreign matters are prevented from being caught between polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, sheet backup <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotatively supported by swing mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Even if the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inclined, polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be rotated closely in contact with the substrate surface. Thus, stability is ensured during rotation, and polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be reliably brought into contact with liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereby the problems associated with the precision and undulation of the surface of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. Furthermore, cleaning efficiency is enhanced and foreign matters are prevented from being caught between liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereby drawing of the foreign matters, panel scratches, and re-adhesion of the foreign matters can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, load cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can control a pressure of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> against liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pressure of polishing sheet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> against liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be properly controlled, whereby cleaning effect is enhanced, cleaning capability is stabilized, and cell gap unevenness of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Note that although the liquid crystal panel is used as a substrate in the above described embodiment, a panel for an EL (electroluminescence) display or plasma display, or a wafer may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As in the foregoing, the substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention allows the sheet to be automatically rotated by the rotating unit for cleaning the substrate surface. Thus, unlike the conventional manual cleaning, a loss time and operation time for removing foreign matters can be reduced, whereby the efficiency of the removal operation is enhanced and stabilized. Thus, the foreign matters can be reliably removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In addition, the roll can automatically feed the sheet. Thus, a new portion of sheet is always used for cleaning and the operation loss associated with sheet feeding would not be caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a toothbrush that also comprises two other dental hygiene accessories such as a small interdental hardbrush and a rubber cone shaped periodontal gum massager and stimulator, ready for use as part of the same artifact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the field of dental hygiene, the dentists have available a multiplicity of tools and brushes that they use for cleaning the teeth, massaging the gums and preventing periodontal diseases. The dentists recommend that in addition to brush cleaning the teeth with a conventional toothbrush, every person should as frequently as possible, individually, massage and stimulate the gums to firm the gum tissue and prevent periodontal disease. To achieve this effect, a rubber pointed cone shaped massager and stimulator tip, small enough for insertion into and between two teeth, at the gum line, should be used. On insertion between the teeth, the user applies light pressure to the rubber tip so that, besides acting like a toothpick, dislodging from the little spaces any possible minuscule particle, with a circular motion, it will also massage and stimulate the gums. Until now, the said rubber tip has been generally attached at right angles to the end of a special tool, to a separate small diameter bent tubular tool, or molded firmly on and projecting from the end of a toothbrush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Dentists recommend also to brush the curved faces of the teeth where they interface with the gums, and so a small compact interdental hard brush should be used to fit in the pocket space formed by the gum and two adjacent teeth. By moving this small hard brush in and out, and side to side, it cleans the portions of the teeth generally not reached by a conventional toothbrush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In fact, these unrelated operations require, besides the conventional toothbrush, two different tools to efficiently accomplish the perfect tooth brushing and lateral cleaning, as well as gum massage functions. All the three tools, if separate, are difficult to handle, package, carry around and are independently vulnerable to loss, damage, contamination, never seem to be available when needed, and are very inconvenient for separate storage and accessability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> All of the heretofor known toothbrushes that contain a rubber gum massager and stimulator tip attached to the end of the handle suffer from a number of disadvantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (a) when said gum massager and stimulator tip is positioned on the end of the handle, it projects outwardly normal to the flat face of the handle, and when the toothbrush user grabs the handle, the rubber point bent over and can become damaged; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (b) the said gum massager and stimulator tip on the end of the handle can become contaminated by the hand of the user when he (or she) handles the toothbrush and his (or her) hand overlaps the projecting rubber point; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (c) the said gum massage stimulator tip molded onto the handle cannot be removed or replaced if needed, should the rubber point becomes broken or worn by the hands of the user, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (d) when, after brushing, the said toothbrush ending projecting gum massager and stimulator tip is put away and is not thoroughly covered or wrapped, it can become disclored, dirty or contaminated from exposure to the surrounding where it was retained in. This contamination, then, is transferred to the gums by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To accommodate the many dental requirements for tools to meet diverse dental situations, prior art has developed a series of systems and arrangements that add and exchange dental tool heads to a variety of handles. This exchange operation requires the user to store, provide access to, and spend time applying and removing the various components during his (or her) toothbrush operation. Such loose components can easily be misplaced, lost, contaminated or just not used because they are not readily available in the time needed to perform at least twice daily the complete tooth and gum hygiene requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,230, Milton Hodosh et all, presents a cheap handle with a removable head. There is little or no need to have loose components that must be stored, protected, found and applied for each toothbrush operation on a regular basis. Every component must be readily available or it will not be used . Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 75,511,276 Kuo-Ming Lee, presents a removable brush head and a latching assembly to lock to the handle. Again, the brush head is a loose component that latches in and out of the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,934,295 Vladamir Gekhter et al, also presents a patent that contains a handle with a multiplicity of removable brushes and tool components that require storage and must be made available for ready use by the toothbrush user. This configuration provides the dentist with considerable options when addressing tooth problems in a dentist office, but is not the type of tool that encourages ready, constant, scheduled, dedicated everyday individual user to spend needed time and deligence on his (or her) dental hygiene requirements. To encourage good dental practices, the required tools must be on hand, ready for immediate use, and not inside a box or in a drawer, forgotten or overlooked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The uniqueness of the present ready to use triple-clean effect toothbrush does not infringe on either of the above referred to Patents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a means for combining the brushing cleaning function with the gum massage function and the much needed interdental brush function, all in one tool. In order to achieve the triple clean effect of this toothbrush, the body of the tool contains at one end the brush with the bristles clustered in groups to provide an efficient pattern to fully brush the teeth externally, in a conventional manner. These bristles are captured in the end of the toothbrush body, in an elongated pattern, and are firmly molded into the material. In this invention, the toothbrush body contains a means for providing a gum massage stimulator tip and a small interdental hard brush in the same toothbrush body, for ready use by the user. This is achieved by internal hollow spaces in the toothbrush body that form the handle, and a portion of the toothbrush body that holds the bristles. This unique arrangement holds together all three components of a triple-clean tool, thus providing tooth brushing, interdental clean-and-brush functions, as well as gum massaging, all in one handy toothbrush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Presently, and because it has been found that a separate tool for each function has caused inconvenience for storage and availabililty, there are several objects and advantages of this invention when creating a single triple-clean toothbrush: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (a) the three necessary teeth and gum brushing, cleaning and massaging functions are combined in one single tool; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (b) the three tools are readily available to the user; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (c) the three tools are positioned in such way that each of them will not be mishandled and contaminated by the user while he (she) is using any of the other two tools; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (d) the interdental hard brush and the gum massager and stimulator tip are protected from damage by being incased in the toothbrush; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (e) there is a need to have all three functions readily available when people are brushing their teeth and, at the same time, taking care of the gums, following every dentist&apos;s instructions for perfect oral hygiene. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">First Embodiment of this Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A typical embodiment of the assemblage of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, plan view, with the interdental hard brush and gum massage stimulator tip retracted in tandem, in the two ends of the toothbrush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a means for combining the brushing cleaning function with the gum massage function and the much needed interdental brush function, all in one tool. In order to achieve the triple clean effect of this toothbrush, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the toothbrush (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) and its handle (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of the tool containing at one end the bristles (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) of the brush (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), clustered in groups, to provide an efficient pattern to fully brush the teeth externally, in a conventional manner. These said bristles are captured in the end of said toothbrush in an elongated pattern and are firmly molded into the toothbrush body (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Inside this said toothbrush and its handle, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is a tubular hollow chamber (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) that runs the full length of the handle. In addition, the handle is narrow (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and slim for a short distance from the brush end up to the area where the user holds the said handle for ease of entering and brushing the teeth in the mouth. At this point where the user holds the tool, the handle is widened out to provide a wider and firmer grip for grasping the tool and contains recessed into this grip area the said hollow chamber (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) that contains a sliding button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) that is keyed (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) to a slide (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) that slides back and forth on the inside of the said tubular hollow chamber in the tool. Attached to the end of this said slide there is an extension tube (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) that holds the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) for brushing in the gaps and spaces between the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The said sliding button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) can be moved horizontally in a slot (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) that controls its travel distance, in either direction. Movement in one direction extends the interdental hard brush out of one end of the toothbrush, ready for use. Movement of the said button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) keyed (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) to a slider (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) that has the said internal sliding tube (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>), extending out of one end provides movement that, in the opposite direction, retracts the said interdental hard brush into a pocket (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in the toothbrush, below the section where the bristles are molded into the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In like manner, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the opposite end of the toothbrush containing an identical sliding button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) an extension tube (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>), a key (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>), and a slide (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) in the long hollow chamber (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) within the handle section of the toothbrush and the movement of the said button extends and retracts the said extension tube that is keyed to the said slide that holds on its end the gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). Movement of the button in the said slot (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) in one direction extends the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>), ready for use at the other end of the toothbrush, and movement of the said button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) in the opposite direction retracts it into the handle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows both the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) retracted into the toothbrush. The toothbrush user has now available all three functional tools in one assembly. All three are held firmly in the same tool and readily available for addressing each tooth cleaning function as needed, in any cleaning order, at the user discretion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The ends of the said internal sliding extension tube (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) are made to accept at either end of the said toothbrush the said gum massage stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) or the said interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). This invention could accept other end attachments such as a toothpick, dental floss, or other dentist recommended cleaning or treatment tools, should they be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Both the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the said interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) can be replaced as needed. The respective said sliding extension tubes have replacement capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It has been found that if the user applies diligently to all three cleaning, brushing and massaging functions on a regular basis, the life of the three components is about equal, i,e., all three will wear out at about the same time. Therefore, the brush user will replace the inexpensive assembly rather than attempt to replace individual parts. For that reason, no complex latching functions are needed in this triple-clean toothbrush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For assembly and manufacturing purposes, and should there be a need for replacement of the said rubber tip that constitutes the gum massager and stimulator, or the said interdental hard brush, the said extension tubes (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) contain a slit (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) down one side, or two sides if needed, to permit the tube to be expanded in diameter and allow insertion of the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) or said interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) to be forceably pressed into the said extension tube. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> an enlarged view shows how the said slit in the tube side walls capture and hold the stem (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) of the said gum massager and stimulator tip and said interdental hard brush by deflection of the said slit tube side walls. The said stem is slightly reduced in diameter where the said sliding tube side walls grasp the said stem and capture it. The said stem contains minor indentations to impede easy removal from the said slit extension tubes and the inner wall of the said extension tubes is course machined to increase the resistance of component removal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment of this Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This embodiment also provides a means for combining the brushing cleaning function with the gum massage and stimulation functions and the much needed interdental brush function all in one tool but the assemblage places the interdental hard brush and the gum massager and stimulator tip, are both at the opposite end of the toothbrush bristles, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The toothbrush handle (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of this tool embodiment contains at one end the toothbrush (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) with the bristles (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) clustered in groups, in a conventional manner. In this embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the said handle (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) comprising of two hollow cylinders (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) shown in a sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> that run the full length of the handle. In addition, the handle is narrow and slim (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) for a short distance from the brush end, for ease of brushing and entering into the mouth. At the point where the user holds the said handle, it is widened out to provide this wider grip for grasping the tool and the grip is comprised of the said two hollow cylinders (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) running parallel to each other that retain a sliding button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) that is attached to a slider (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) with a key (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) that runs in a slot (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) and the said key engages the said traveling slider (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) that slides back and forth in each of the said long hollow cylinders that comprise the said handle as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The travel length is defined by said slot (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) in each of the said hollow cylinders and the said key (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) engages both the said button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) and the said traveling slider (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). Attached to the end of the said slider is an extension tube (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) that holds the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) for brushing in the gaps and spaces between the teeth. The said sliding button can be moved a short distance, horizontally in its said slot, in the two said hollow cylinders, in either direction. Movement in one direction extends, ready for use, the said interdental hard brush out of the end of one of the said hollow cylinders, that is part of the said handle of the toothbrush. Movement of the said button attached to the said internal extension tube, in the opposite direction, retracts the said interdental hard brush into the said tube, that is part of the said toothbrush handle. In like manner, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, within the second parallel hollow cylinder, but on the opposite side of the said toothbrush handle, the embodiment contains an identical button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>), and sliding tube (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) in the long cavity (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) of the two said hollow cylinders that form the said handle of the toothbrush, and the movement of the said button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) extends and retracts the said extension tube that has attached to its end the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the said gum massager and stimulator tip extended and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows it retracted. Movement in one direction extends out the said gum massager and stimulator tip, ready for use, and movement of the said button in the opposite direction retracts it into the said hollow cylinder that is part of said handle of the toothbrush. The said button that moves the said slider can be located as shown in sectional <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> on the center of the said handle or at any position around the perimeter of the said cylinders, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The toothbrush user has available all three functional tools in one assembly, all held firmly in the same tool and easily available for addressing each tooth cleaning function as needed, independently, in any cleaning order, at the user discretion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The ends of the said internal sliding extension tubes are made to accept either the said gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), the said interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) or other dentist recommended cleaning or treatment tools. Both the said gum massager and stimulator tip and the said interdental hard brush can be replaced as needed. The said sliding tube extensions save replacement capabilities,as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Both said cylinders that form the said handle of the toothbrush, and contain inside the two said additional tools, have close-out caps (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>) hinged to the cylinder ends to seal them and avoid damage and any possible contamination. The said close-out caps can be rotated open as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> by movement of the said button (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) to the extend position which pushes open the said close-out cap. After the cleaning of the respective tools, following their use, the said caps are rotated back into the end of the said cylinders, to seal them. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The assemblage of this embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&mdash;<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, places the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) and the gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) at the opposite end from the conventional bristles of the toothbrush (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) in two recess chambers (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) that run parallel to each other in the handle (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). Within each said recess chamber there is installed a sliding cover (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) for closing out the said recess chamber and a tubular support arm (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) that is Tee-shaped with the cross member (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) providing an axis (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> ) for the said Tee to rotate around a pivot upward out of the said recess chamber. The said cross member contains two projection pins (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) that work like an axle that locate it in the said recess chamber (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) and each said projection pin engages a hole (<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) located on the sidewall of the said recess chamber. With these said projection pins positioned in their said mating hole, the said support can be rotated around the said axis provided by these said projecting pins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The other end of the said tubular support arm provides an extension tube (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) with the slit sidewalls as previously shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> for insertion of the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) or the gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). As said tubular support arm is narrow and sits in its said toothbrush handle recess chamber with ample room about it, then the user can easily grasp it with his fingers and rotate it out of the said handle recess chamber. After rotation to the extended work position, the cover (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) can be slid over the pivot point (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) and locks it in the extended location, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The recess chamber that contains these rotating tools can be located on any side of the said handle that is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, each said recess chamber (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) in said toothbrush handle is provided with said sliding cover (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, that protects the internal dental tools from damage by handling and contamination. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> in this embodiment shows the said covers slid back in the open position and the tools are available in their protective recess chambers (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) . With the said covers in the open position the tools can be rotated out ready for use as shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> each said cover contains serrated grooves (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) to make it easy to slide the cover open and closed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates how either tool can be rotated to the user position easily and quickly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a cross section through the said pivot point and shows how the said cover (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) slides in said grooves molded in the side walls of the said recess chamber (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) and captures the said tubular arm cross member (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) in a locked position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Fourth Embodiment of this invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the toothbrush (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) two knurled or serrated threaded sleeves (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) are provided to extend or retract the interdental hard brush (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) and the gum massager and stimulator tip (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) out of the handle (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Each of these said threaded sleeves, when rotated individually threads out an threaded internal shaft (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) that extends the tubular extension with the said interdental hard brush and said gum massager and stimulator tip attached to their ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Opposite rotation of each of the said sleeves retracts the said threaded internal shaft and this causes the retraction of said interdental hard brush and said gum massager and stimulator tip into the chamber that forms the handle of the said toothbrush. Close-out caps (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>) hinged to the tube ends will close each tube to prevent damage and contamination These said close-out caps, or covers, operate and are attached to the said toothbrush handle in a similar manner as shown and described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of a previous embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows structural cross members (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) that capture and support the said threaded sleeves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The body of said handle is comprised of three chambers, a forward closed chamber (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>), a closed aft chamber (<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>) and a center open chamber (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) that captures the two threaded sleeves and provides access to them by rotating them to screw in and out the said internal threaded shaft with extension tubes (<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) that hold the said interdental hard brush and the said gum massager and stimulator tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the said interdental hard brush and the said gum massager and stimulator tip are attached to said tubular extensions (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) that extend from the end of the said threaded shaft (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). and both interdental hard brush and gum massager and stimulator attach to the said tubular extension in the manner described in previous embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This invention is simple in construction, easy to operate, unique in arrangement, function and assembly, and lends itself to economical manufacture. These features of the various embodiments, together with other objects and advantages which become subsequently apparent, reside in the details of the construction and operation, as more fully herein described and claimed, reference being added in the accompanying drawings, forming a part herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Although the description above contains many specifications, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, but as merely providing illustrations of some of the present embodiments of the invention, as well as equivalent embodiments. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A rechargeable industrial broom is provided having a base unit having an overall width of approximately 24 inches. At the base are formed an intake orifice, and stationary bristles. The stationary bristles are attached to the broom by means of a 12 inch suction pipe and a swivel nozzle. The nozzle allows the broom to move at any angle. A bag, similar in design to the conventional vacuum bag, is connected to the back of the unit. The cloth bag snaps onto a discharge orifice, and debris captured by the broom eventually makes its way to this bag. At the bottom of the bag is a zipper for waste removal. The broom is powered by a 12-volt in-line motor. A rechargeable adapter can be incorporated directly into the interior of the broom. </paragraph>

The first involves a centralized vacuum source wherein a distribution system is made in communication with a centralized collection system. Although such systems allow for the use of higher capacity blowers and vacuums, because of their size and space restrictions they are not as adaptable to the needs of the industrial user. The second system involves essentially a smaller scale system located on a transportation means, such as a movable, wheeled cart. Such a system, although effective in theory, still greatly limit the practical use, control, reach, storage, and portability. Consequently, a need has therefore been felt for such a rechargeable, industrial broom as described below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved industrial broom for effectively collecting debris. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of the present invention to provide an improved industrial broom including an adjustable swivel nozzle that allows the user to adjust the angle of collection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Briefly described according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a rechargeable industrial broom is provided having a base unit having an overall width of approximately 24 inches. At the base is formed an intake orifice, and stationary bristles. The stationary bristles are attached to the broom by means of a 12-inch suction pipe and a swivel nozzle. The nozzle allows the broom to move at any angle. A bag, similar in design to the conventional vacuum bag, is connected to the back of the unit. The cloth bag snaps onto a discharge orifice, and debris captured by the broom eventually makes its way to this bag. At the bottom of the bag is a zipper for waste removal. The broom is powered by a 12-volt in-line motor. A rechargeable adapter can be incorporated directly into the interior of the broom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the present invention are many. The stationary bristles collect the scattered debris, and the suction mouth, capable of extending up to 24 inches with the pull of a lever, pulls debris from the floor. The bristles and suction mouth are able to move in any direction due to the swivel nozzle, thereby assuring complete coverage of even hard to reach areas. Once debris is captured, it is deposited into the cloth bag, which can be easily emptied and replaced. The rechargeable battery eliminates the needs for cords, and improves access and portability.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the complete relationship of the invention, it is essential that some description be given to the manner and practice of functional utility and description of a rechargeable industrial broom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The best mode for carrying out the invention is presented in terms of its preferred embodiment, herein depicted within the Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 1. Detailed Description of the Figures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> front elevational view of a rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. The rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a operating handle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is attached to a main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contains most of the major operating components of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and will be described in greater detail herein below. The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> possesses a waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, shown attached to the rear of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on its left hand side as viewed from the front as shown. The waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is secured via a attachment chain <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Exiting the bottom of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a main suction tube <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, through which all vacuumed waste is routed. The main suction tube <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to a swivel joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The swivel joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> allows for the connection and subsequent movement along a linear axis of a nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is positioned along a surface to be cleaned such as a floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that the angular displacement of the operating handle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> would be approximately 20 degrees in either direction from its vertical position as shown. Along the lower edge of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is positioned a multitude of brush bristles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The brush bristles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> aid in picking up small pieces of waste from the floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that the brush bristles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are of the replaceable nature by the final user, since the brush bristles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will be in constant contact with the floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and subject to wear on a regular, continuous basis. The total overall height of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is approximately 60 inches. However, the dimensions as well as the depicted configuration of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not intended to be a limiting factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> rear elevational view of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted. The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is once again shown with the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> exiting now on the right. The waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to a waste discharge tube <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via a connecting clamp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> attachment chain <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> once again prevents excessive movement of the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A zipper <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided to empty the contents of the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The zipper <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is simply unzipped and the contents of the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> emptied into a receptacle such as a trash can. The zipper <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is then zipped to a closed position and the vacuuming process continues. Located on the operating handle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is an on/off switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, which operates in the usual and customary manner, and a nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is used to adjust the width of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The mechanism and system by which the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is adjusted in width will be described in greater detail herein below. Located on the rear of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a rear access cover <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, which is held in place by a plurality of fastening means <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> such as screws. The removal of the rear access cover <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> allows access to a primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and a secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which are used to provide electrical power to the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Located below the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a direct current motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> which is coupled to an vacuum impeller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by a drive belt <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The system of the direct current motor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the vacuum impeller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the drive belt <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are the components which produce the vacuum effect to allow the removal of waste from the floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. All of the components located under the rear access cover <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> are shown in phantom lines to indicate their usual hidden position, and are shown here for purposes of clarity only. Located on the upper portion of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a battery recharge adapter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a low battery indicator light <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and a battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The battery recharge adapter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is used to allow recharging of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at any location where a convenience outlet is present. Thus it is not necessary to utilize a separate recharger when using the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The low battery indicator light <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is used to indicate the electrical charge condition of either the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> or the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as selected by the battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> allows the user of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to select either the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> or the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the purposes of operating the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that the user would first begin operation of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and use it until the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is depleted. The user would then switch the battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> over to the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and continue his or her cleaning duties, with the knowledge that the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must be recharged at the earliest possible time. In this manner the user does not have to stop cleaning duties or have the cleaning operation interrupted by discharged batteries as is the normal case with only one battery. The circuitry associated with the charging and operation of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is readily known and may take many final configurations not depicted here. Shown exiting the lower portion of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a rear wheel support brace <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, which is used to position a rear wheel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which is used in the unattended vertical support of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown. The arrangement of the rear wheel support brace <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and its associated rear wheel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> will become clearer during additional descriptions below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> side elevational view of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disclosed. This view more clearly depicts the supporting nature of the rear wheel support brace <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Further aiding in the gliding of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over the floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is a first front wheel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, located immediately behind the brush bristles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A second front wheel <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, not shown in this view for purposes of clarity, is located on the opposite side of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is shown in an easy to grasp area of the operating handle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> directly above the on/off switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is envisioned to be of a sleeved cable arrangement, similar to that found on bicycles, to allow the adjustment of the width of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A control cable <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, which is the lower portion of the cable connected to the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is shown exiting the lower portion of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and connecting to a first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> detailed partial view of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> shown in its retracted or collapsed state is shown. This view is as seen along the rear of the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. (Similar to that seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but without the rear wheel support brace <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). The first front wheel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the second front wheel <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are clearly shown as providing a bearing surface for the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The control cable <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> located in front of the main suction tube <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> attaches to the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> below the swivel joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In its retracted state as shown, the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> then produces a tension effect in a first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and a second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> being pivotally joined via a fastening means in an overlapping manner at ends forming the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Upon squeezing the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> the control cable is retracted, thereby causing the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to be retracted upward. This in turn simultaneously causes the first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> to pivot about the second pivot point in a counter-clockwise direction and the second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to pivot about the third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction, thereby resulting in resistant tension in tightly wound springs <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> (as will be described in greater detail below) around each respective retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Because of the overlapping design of the first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, this action in turn causes the second pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to travel in an inward path, as depicted by a pair of inward direction arrows <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the accordion like nature of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to collapse and be drawn inward to effect a suction path with approximately 12 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It should be noted however that this dimension is not a limiting factor and could be revised to any desired dimension by changing the geometry of the above components respectively. It is envisioned that the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> would be constructed of a flexible plastic to allow for the accordion like retraction to take effect. When the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is in its retracted state as shown, the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be used to get into smaller areas that a wider nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> could not. The retracted state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> occurs when the user squeezes the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (not shown in this FIG.) and overcomes the tension in a first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and a second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> as attached to the second pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> respectively. First spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are generally of a coil spring type having a hollow core and adapted for use in pivoting joints such as a pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. One end of first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is permanently integrally attached to a point on second pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The other end of first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is wound around first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, respectively, to prevent first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to second pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> impart a clockwise and counter-clockwise moment onto the first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> respectively thus resulting in a nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which is spread out in a direction opposite to that shown by the inward direction arrows <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and whose resultant outcome will be shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring finally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> detailed partial view of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> shown in its extended state is disclosed. The first spring <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second spring <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are now imparting a clockwise and counter-clockwise moment onto the first retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the second retractable arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> respectively and causing the resultant extension about the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Upon release of the width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> by the user, the first pivot point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is not held in an upper position near the swivel joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by the control cable <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, so it travels downwards toward the lower portion of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing the resistant tension in the tightly wound springs <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> around each respective retractable arm <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. This in turn causing the second pivot point <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the third pivot point <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to travel in an outward path, thus causing an extension effect on the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as depicted by a pair of outward direction arrows <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This extended state of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is approximately 24 inches or a doubling of the 12 inches as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. It should be noted however that these dimensions are not intended to be a limiting factor as aforementioned described. In this intended state, the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can cover double the floor area and is suitable for normal area use where increased coverage is the prime consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 2. Operation of the Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In operation, the present invention can be easily utilized by the common user in a simple and effortless manner. To use the present invention with its preferred embodiment can best be described in conjunction with the elevational views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the detailed partial views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To use the present invention, the user would first remove the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from its charging location and transport the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to its location of use. Next the user would check the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to make certain the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is emptied of any previous waste. Next, the battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> would be placed in the primary battery position and the capacity of the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> verified by lack of illumination of the low battery indicator light <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. At this point the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The user would next activate the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by operating the on/off switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and begin the vacuuming of the floor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a normal and customary manner. It should be noted that the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is in its extended state of approximately 24 inches at this point without the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being operated by the user. This wide path allows for the greatest coverage pattern by the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Should the user come to a location where the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> will not fit such as around tables, chairs, benches, machines, or other such objects, the user may simply squeeze the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and thus cause the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to retract to approximately 12 inches as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Vacuuming may then continue in an uninterrupted manner. When the user is finished vacuuming around obstacles and no longer requires the retracted nature of the nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the user simply releases the nozzle width adjustment lever <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and resumes vacuuming with the extended nozzle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in an uninterrupted manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Should the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> reach its discharged state, the user may simply activate the battery selector switch <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and continue vacuuming. The user must bear in mind that the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should be recharged at the earliest possible time, however, the vacuuming chore at hand may be completed without interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the vacuuming duty is completed, the user transports the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to its storage charging location. Next, the user empties the waste collection bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of its collected contents into a trash receptacle. The user then plugs the battery recharge adapter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> into a standard convenience receptacle to allow both the primary battery <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to recharge. After completion of the recharging cycle, the rechargeable industrial broom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready to be used again and the above cycle repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description is included to illustrate the operation of the preferred embodiment and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an upright type vacuum cleaner, and more particularly, to an upright type vacuum cleaner having a cyclone type dust collector capable of separating by centrifugal force and collecting minute particle dust and large particle contaminants from the air that is drawn in through a suction brush of the vacuum cleaner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, an upright type vacuum cleaner includes a suction brush disposed at an end of a vacuum cleaner body for movement across a cleaning surface. An inner space of the vacuum cleaner body is divided into a dust chamber and a motor chamber. A dust filter is removably disposed in the dust chamber. A motor is disposed in the motor driving chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When the motor operates, a strong suction force is generated at the suction brush. The suction force draws contaminants through the suction brush and into the vacuum cleaner body. Once inside the vacuum cleaner body, the air passes through the dust filter, which is disposed in the dust chamber, and is discharged out of the vacuum cleaner. During this process, contaminants in the air are filtered out at the dust filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the upright type vacuum cleaner described above, contaminants, such as dust or dirt, are collected with the use of a dust filter. Accordingly, a user has to provide additional filters for replacement. In addition, the dust filter must be replaced manually, which can be unhygienic for the user. </paragraph>

Since the fine holes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed discontinuously, the air does not flow into the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while descending toward the bottom of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It is also preferable that the first and second air inlets <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>partially overlap each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is removably disposed at a lower end of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow disposal of the contaminants from the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the present invention, the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is screwed onto the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The reverse flow prevention portion prevents contaminants from flowing upward from the lower portions of the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The reverse flow prevention portion includes a main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which protrudes from an inner circumference of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extends upward by a predetermined height from the center of the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> slopes in and down from the inner circumference of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> toward the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in order to effectively prevent contaminants from flowing upward from the bottom of first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> along the inner circumference of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed in the center of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. By restricting the flow of minute particle dust collected in the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> minimizes the possibility of a reverse flow of the minute particle dust. Further, the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a sub-rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that radially extends from the upper circumference of the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The sub-rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> restricts the minute particle dust from flowing from the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the outer circumference of the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The sub-rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is downwardly inclined by a predetermined angle from the upper circumference of the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The operation of an upright type vacuum cleaner with a cyclone type dust collector in accordance with the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> First, the vacuum cleaner, in which the cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is installed, is turned on. The suction brush <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> draws air, along with ambient dust and other contaminants, on and around the cleaning surface into the vacuum cleaner. The air flows through the suction hose <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and air inlet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to the first air inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the dust collector <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. After being drawn in, the cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> cooperate to induce the air into a vortex. The vortex of air descends toward the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. At this time, the larger particle contaminants are separated by the centrifugal force of the vortex and collected on the bottom of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Once the vortex of air reaches the bottom of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the vortex of air ascends. In such a situation, some of the collected contaminants may also rise along the inner circumference of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the ascending vortex of air. The rising contaminants are blocked by the main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, however, and fall back to the bottom of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As a result, the main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> improves the contaminant collecting efficiency of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Further, since the main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is inclined down and in toward the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, any possible reverse flow of contaminants along the main rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, the vortex of air rising from the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, flows into the second air inlet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the outer body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. After flowing in through the second air inlet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the air is guided in a diagonal direction into a second vortex in the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the minute particle dust is separated from the air by the centrifugal force of the vortex, and the minute particle dust falls onto the bottom of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The vortex of air, descending in the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, also rises after reaching the bottom. The ascending vortex of air in the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, reaches a defined space between the outlet pipe <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and is drawn into the outlet pipe <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by the different air pressures caused by different current velocities of upper and lower areas. The air in the outlet pipe <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is then released through the air outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the lighter air, which reaches the center of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, also turns up and directly ascends. According to this embodiment, the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided at the center of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, restricting any reverse flow or movement of the minute dust that is collected in the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Further, in case of any reverse flow of a few minute particles of dust, the dust is blocked by the sub-rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> formed at the upper end of the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and falls back to the bottom of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Here also, since the sub-rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is downwardly inclined at a predetermined angle, the minute particle dust is blocked more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are full of dust and contaminants, the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be opened to remove the dust and contaminants. In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, the lower door <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is removably screwed onto the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view illustrating a cyclone type dust collector in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Since the basic structure of the dust collector is identical to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, like elements will be given the same reference numerals throughout the description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The cyclone type dust collector shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> includes a hinge shaft H which pivotally connects a side of the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Since the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled to the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the hinge shaft H, the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is supported on the bottom of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, the cyclone type dust collector includes a locking/unlocking portion for locking or unlocking the other end of the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to or from the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The locking/unlocking portion includes a locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> formed in the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> movably disposed on a handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to correspond to the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a first pressing member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for biasing the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in a direction where the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is inserted in the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and an unlocking unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for removing the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> from the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by overcoming the elasticity of the first pressing member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Here, it is preferable that the first pressing member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a coil spring, which is disposed around the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to elastically bias the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> toward the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The unlocking unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> includes an unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed at one side of the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> enters or exits with respect to one side, a second pressing member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> for biasing the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outward, a wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> having one end connected to the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and a pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> pivotally disposed in the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The second pressing member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is a coil spring which is disposed around the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to elastically bias the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outward. It is also preferable that the wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is an elastic member, such as an elastic string or a long coil spring. One end of the wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected to the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and the other end is connected to one end of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The other end of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> contacts the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the center of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is pivotally supported in the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The operation of an upright type vacuum cleaner having the cyclone type dust collector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In order to open or close the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a user presses the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. When the unlocking button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is pressed into the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it presses one end of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> downward, while the other end of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> pivots upward. Simultaneously, the wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which is connected to other end of the pivot member <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, also moves upward, pulling the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> pulls the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to remove the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> from the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. As the locking rod <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> disengages from the locking groove <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the weight of the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> causes the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to pivot about the hinge shaft H, thereby opening the lower side of the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described above, the dust collecting efficiency of the cyclone type dust collector is increased by preventing a reverse flow of collected contaminants. Furthermore, the locking/unlocking portion enables a user to open and close the lower door <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> more easily, thereby facilitating disposal of the contaminants that have collected in the dust collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the upright type vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a dust chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a motor driving chamber <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and a cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> removably disposed in the dust chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A suction brush <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to a lower end of a vacuum cleaner body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The suction brush <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to a suction hose <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected to an air inlet <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> formed on a side of the dust chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The motor driving chamber <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is interconnected with the dust chamber through an air outlet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is formed on the bottom of the dust chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> separates by centrifugal force and collects contaminants from the air that is drawn in through the suction brush <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The plane side <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> has a dual-structure in which an outer body having a plurality of fine holes <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed therein in a predetermined pattern (i.e., a grill <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>A), and an inner body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>B concentrically disposed within the grill <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>A. An air outlet (not shown) is formed in the upper end of the inner body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>B. Further, an outlet pipe <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> extends along the inner body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>B, diagonally curving at a predetermined radius of curvature to induce the air from the air outlet into a vortex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is preferable that the openings of the air outlet and outlet pipe <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> partially overlap the opening of the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In addition, a reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> extends upward a predetermined height from the center of the bottom side <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is arranged in such a manner that the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> faces the funnel-shaped suction pipe <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> along the substantially same axis. Further, the leading ends of the suction pipe <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are spaced from each other by a predetermined distance to define a second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the first, second, and third outlet pipes <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> are integrally formed on the outer surface of the cover <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, respectively, and are interconnected with each other. Although the first, second, and third outlet pipes <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> are separately formed in this embodiment, the same can be replaced by one pipe member as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Another variation may be applied, in which a predetermined portion of the second outlet pipe <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to serve as a handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The operation of the upright type vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having the cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When the vacuum cleaner <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with the cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> installed in the dust chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, is turned on, air and dust and contaminants entrained in the air are drawn in through the suction brush <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, through the suction hose <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the air inlet <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and into the tube <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> formed in the cover <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the cyclone type dust collector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As the air flows through the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and into the space defined between the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, respectively, the air is induced into a vortex (indicated by the larger headed, solid line arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The air descends toward the bottom of the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this descending vortex of air, larger particle contaminants are separated from the air by centrifugal force and fall to the bottom of the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Next, the vortex of air descends in the space between the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and ascends after reaching the bottom of the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Here, dust and contaminants floating in the air are blocked by the reverse flow prevention rib <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and fall back onto the bottom of the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When the vortex of air, rising from the bottom of the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, reaches the grill <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>A of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the air flows into the first space s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> defined between the grill <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>A and the inner body <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>B through the plurality of fine holes <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, minute particle dust is separated from the air by centrifugal force and falls to the bottom of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the descending vortex of air rises when it reaches the bottom side <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In such a situation, floating dust and contaminants in the ascending air (indicated by the smaller headed, dotted line arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) are blocked by the rib <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>protruding from the inner circumference of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and fall back to the bottom side <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The ascending vortex of air reaches the second space s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, defined between the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the reverse flow prevention pipe <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of the second cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. At the second space s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the air is drawn directly into the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> as a result of the different pressures caused by different flow velocities of the air at upper and lower areas of the second space s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The air that has been drawn into the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> (indicated by the short straight arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is exhausted through first, second, and third outlet pipes <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, exhaust port <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and motor driving chamber <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The contaminants collected in the first and second cyclone receptacles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be removed by separating the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> from the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and disposing of the contaminants contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> have threads, respectively, which are complementary to each other, enabling the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to be secured to the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, the base <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the first cyclone receptacle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be connected together other by a plurality of fastening methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the upright type vacuum cleaner having the cyclone type dust collector described above, the minute dust particles and larger particle contaminants are systematically separated from the air based on their sizes. Further, since the cyclone type dust collector of the present invention has a filtering process that prevents a reverse flow of dust and contaminants, the cleaning performance and efficiency of the vacuum cleaner are greatly improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Further, by integrally forming the outlet pipe on the cyclone type dust collector, the vacuum cleaner body can be more compact in size. In addition, due to the detachable structure of the cyclone type dust collector, the dust and contaminants collected in the cyclone type dust collector can be disposed of more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As stated above, a preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown and described. Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it is understood that the present invention should not be limited to this preferred embodiments. Various changes and modifications can be made by one skilled in the art within the spirit and scope of the present invention as hereinafter claimed. </paragraph>

The housing includes at least one air inlet and a nozzle opening spaced from the air inlet, a brushroll rotatably mounted in the housing and within the nozzle opening and a turbine. The turbine is drivingly connected to the brushroll for rotating the brushroll. The turbine is driven by a first airflow through the air inlet. A rotational axis of the brushroll is parallel to a longitudinal axis of the turbine and parallel to a longitudinal axis of the housing. A first conduit is located in the housing and connected to the nozzle opening. A second airflow occurs through the first conduit. A second conduit is fluidly connected to the first conduit and to a third conduit. The first and second airflows merge into the second conduit. A swivel attachment is connected to the third conduit and swivels the housing between two positions approximately 180 degrees apart and is locked into one of the two positions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an auxiliary tool for vacuum cleaners. More particularly, the present invention relates to a turbine driven brushing tool which is attached to a separate vacuum suctioning unit and is used to suction dirt and debris from carpets, floors, and above-floor surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Air is drawn into the turbo tool to drive a turbine contained in the tool. By adding a system of gear reductions, the rotational motion of the turbine is used to drive a rotating brush. There are typically several gears and/or belts between the turbine and the brush. The end result is often a brushroll that spins much slower than the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Turbine driven brushing tools have become extremely popular for cleaning a variety of surfaces in homes, offices, or wherever there are hard-to-reach places. These tools are relatively light weight and are attached to a separate suctioning unit, such as a vacuum cleaner, to provide air suction to the tool. As will be appreciated, such tools are utilized typically for small clean-up jobs or hard-to-reach places. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are several prior art dry turbo tools that are available. Most of these prior art turbo tools do not provide for a separate clean air inlet channel to a turbine. Rather, suction air is used to power the turbine. As a result, drawback of the known dry turbo tools is that they draw the dirt and debris directly through the turbine, thus potentially damaging the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another drawback with the prior art dry turbo tools is that they can only be used in one orientation; that is, the tool head cannot be rotated 180&deg; between two orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Yet another drawback of prior art dry turbo tools is that they do not provide staggered air channels that guide air directly into a turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a new and improved dry turbo tool which would overcome the foregoing deficiencies and others while meeting the above-stated needs and providing better and more advantageous overall results. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a turbo tool A according to one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The turbo tool A includes a main housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which has a first portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The first and second portions are secured to each other by suitable fasteners (not illustrated) to form a hollow section. The housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from a thermoplastic material. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> brushroll housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is located within the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The brushroll housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a top section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a bottom section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are secured together by a suitable fastening means (not shown). The brushroll housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also may be fabricated from a thermoplastic material. The brushroll housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> houses a rotatable brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The bottom section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the brushroll housing includes an opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through which dirt and debris is suctioned into the turbo tool. The opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the brushroll housing acts as a suction nozzle of the turbo tool. The brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located within opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and substantially covers the length of the opening to aid in loosening dirt and debris for being extracted from the surface being cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The turbo tool further includes a turbine assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> held within the main housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The turbine assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a turbine rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mounted within a rotor housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a pair of spiraled inlet channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and an exit air channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Air enters the turbine through inlet slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located on exterior walls of the first and second portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a rotational axis <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which is oriented approximately parallel to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the turbine assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the nozzle opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are oriented approximately parallel to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The orientation of the nozzle opening and brushroll allow the tool to be of a compact, narrow size which enables the tool to clean hard-to-reach areas such as room corners, the area between chair backs and seat cushions, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The air entering the turbine passes through a screen <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, preferably made of stainless steel, that is retained between a gear train housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The air then proceeds to the spiraled air turbine inlet channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and to the turbine rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The spiraled inlet channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provide four air paths through two molded sections. Preferably, the two inlet channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are fabricated from thermoplastic material. The inlet channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comprise several staggered openings which provide the advantage of directing the air directly into the turbine. The air then passes through the rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the exit channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and into an exhaust tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The turbine rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rotated by the airflow. The turbine is drivingly connected to the brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by a gear train <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which is housed within the gear train housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The gear train <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> comprises a series of gear reductions and belts which reduce the rotation of the brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with respect to the turbine rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, as the turbine rotor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rotates at a relatively higher rate of speed, the brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated at a relatively lower rate of speed, but with more power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> suction airflow flows through the brushroll housing opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Dirty air and debris are sucked through the opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and into a tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The hose first end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to an opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located in the brushroll housing top section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> above the brushroll <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The hose second end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to a tributary tube <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which communicates with the exhaust tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The two airflows, i.e., the airflow through the turbine and the airflow from the brushroll housing flow in parallel and merge at the exhaust tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. An advantage of this arrangement is that none of the dirt and debris that is pulled through the suction opening enters the turbine assembly. Thus, the turbine assembly is prevented from being damaged. The airflows are separated and merge beyond the rear of the turbine assembly. The combined airflows then pass through the exhaust tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into a hose attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The hose attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is attached to a separate suction source, such as a vacuum cleaner (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The exhaust tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is connected to the hose attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which swivels or pivots approximately 180 degrees and locks into one of two positions. The tool can be used in one of two positions which are approximately 180 degrees apart. This allows for more versatile uses of the tool depending on which orientation of the tool is more convenient for the cleaning task at hand. Also, it allows the user to change the orientation of the tool head without twisting or tangling the hose. The tool is unlocked by depressing a button <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> while rotating the tool. The button <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> locks the tool into position by engaging a notched area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the swivel attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If desired, the button <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be made of an acetal material which acts as a spring when displaced. Thus, the button <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> does not require an additional spring when returning to its original position after being depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, one aspect of the present invention is the provision of a turbine powered brushing tool which has separate air passageways to a turbine and to a suction opening in a brushroll housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is the provision of a turbine powered tool including a spiraled air inlet channel to the turbine which provides directed airflow to the turbine without the need for additional parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Still another aspect of the present invention is the provision of a tool including a locking pivot which enables a user to pivot the tool between two positions approximately 180 degrees apart and lock the tool into position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to one embodiment. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings and in operation, a hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which distributes forces imposed on the hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The first member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are joined by a pivot housing, shown generally at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pivot housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an outer housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the outer housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an integral portion of second member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The pivot housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes an inner housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the inner housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an integral portion of first member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inner housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is journaled in housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to allow the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> do not need to be to integral to the housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be connected to the housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by any known means, including but not limited to fasteners, adhesives, press fitting, tabs and slots, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the disclosed embodiment include first and second flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B for connecting the hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to, for example, a top and a bottom of a seat (not shown). The flanges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B include slots <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for receipt of fasteners (not shown) for attachment thereto. The slots <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> allow for adjustment of the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the seat top and/or bottom. It should be understood that the hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be used on any application that requires a hinge and is not limited to use on a seat. Furthermore, depending on the application, the flanges could be replaced with other attaching systems, or not used, for example the housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> could be integrally formed into the top and bottom portions of a container, such as a toolbox. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is located through apertures <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B of the inner and outer housings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and held in place by a nut <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is particularly strong due to the pivot housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Unlike typical hinges, the pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and nut <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> do not support any of the loads experienced by the hinge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The entire load is distributed between the outer and inner housings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The outer housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes an inner wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and stops <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The inner housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes guide members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The guide members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engage and slide along the inner wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated, the engagement of the guide members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> against the inner wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> distributes the forces between these members and not through the pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The stops <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and guide members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also engage to further distribute the forces between the housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also act against the stops <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to prevent further pivoting of the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to one another and to further distribute the forces acting on the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the stops <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As should be appreciated, there is a slight tolerance between the guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to allow movement between the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but still ensure engagement for properly distributing the forces between the guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed embodiment, there are two stops <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> illustrated. Outer housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also has an inner raised wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and notch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for selective receipt of locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A release pin <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is reciprocally mounted in an opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in notch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to release the locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the disclosed embodiment, there are two locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with each being spring biased by the springs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and springs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are mounted in the locking cavities <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the inner housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the first and second members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are illustrated in the two positions, for example open and closed or up and down if it is a hinge on a seat. As illustrated, the locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are received in the opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> corresponding to each of the two positions. It should also be appreciated that the guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are illustrated slightly spaced from the inner wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, but it should be appreciated that this is slightly over exaggerated. In the preferred embodiment, the guides <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engage the walls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, but permit movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the preferred action of the locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the action of the release pin <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the operation of the pivot housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be described. As illustrated, the pivot housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has two locking positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. In use, the raised wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> engages the locking members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thereby compressing the spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to allow the housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate with respect to one another. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the inner wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is engaging the locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> compressing the spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and allowing for rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown in its locking position with spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> expanded and locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> received within an opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The release pin <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is shown partially depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the release pin <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is shown fully depressed thereby forcing locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into its release position and compressing the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this position, the inner wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can slide over the top portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allowing the pivot housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate. As will be appreciated, in FIG. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the pivot housings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cannot rotate because the locking member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned within the opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. The invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described within the scope of the appended claims, wherein that which is prior art is antecedent to the novelty set forth in the &ldquo;characterized by&rdquo; clause.

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fastening devices for mobile telecommunication units and more particularly to a fastening device including means for coupling said device to the unit and means for fastening the device to a garment or a belt. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Fastening devices, usually called pocket clips, are routinely used to fasten a mobile telephone into a jacket or shirt pocket or onto the belt of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A pocket clip generally has a body including means which cooperate with corresponding means on the rear face of the telephone to couple the clip and the telephone together. The clip also has a tongue which the user can depress to release the fabric or the belt. Thus the clip, when fastened to a belt, for example, is secured to it by the weight of the unit to which it is attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, that kind of clip is an accessory that merely provides a telephone with the fastening function as just described. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to associate the fastening function of a fastening device as defined in the preamble of this application with a second technical function which in the prior art is provided by a separate accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To this end, the invention provides a fastening device for a mobile telecommunication unit, which device includes means for coupling it to the unit and means for fastening it to a garment or a belt, wherein the unit includes an orifice with at least one connector for connection to an external automobile vehicle antenna and the coupling means are conformed to cooperate with the orifice and cover the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus the invention provides a replacement for the protective stopper that is usually placed in the orifice when the latter is not in use. This removes the need for the stopper and has a particular advantage for manufacturers, who no longer need to manufacture and supply such stoppers, and equally for end users, who are no longer distracted by worrying about losing such a small accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to the fastening function, the invention provides a function of protecting the RF connector from impact and from the loss of signal that could result therefrom if the orifice were open when not in use. Also, because the coupling means of the invention cooperate and cover the RF connector, the latter is also hidden, which improves the appearance of the device and adds to its commercial success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the connector is a plug and the coupling means include a coupling sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the coupling means include a plurality of arcs along the perimeter of a circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the device of the invention includes a branch adapted to be coupled to the unit by said coupling means and a branch adapted to be fastened to a garment or a belt by said fastening means, the two branches are connected at a common first end, and the second end of the branch adapted to be coupled to the unit is free and has coupling means on its outside face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the construction and the shape of the free end of the branch adapted to be fastened to a garment or a belt are such that it can exert a clamping force in the other direction when a garment or a belt is introduced between the two branches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the branch adapted to be coupled to the unit is shorter than the branch adapted to be fastened to a garment or a belt, the two branches are substantially parallel over a common length and the remaining portion of the longer branch as far as its free end is curved towards the other branch so that said free end is in substantially the same plane as the shorter branch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, in order to accentuate said clamping force, the free end of the branch adapted to be fastened to a garment or a belt includes means for reducing the gap between that end and the rear face of the unit when the fastening device according to the invention is coupled to the unit. For example, the means for reducing the gap consist of projecting portions on the inside face of the branch adapted to be fastened to a garment or a belt and conformed to contribute uniformly to the clamping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the device of the invention includes means for securing said device to the unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the holding means consist of a rigid collar adapted to surround an external antenna of the unit.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this specification, components with identical functions are indicated by the same reference numbers in the various figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the rear face of a conventional mobile telephone. It shows an external antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to a transceiver, not shown, and usually referred to as a transmitter, inside the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the telephone and enabling bidirectional communication with the network. The antenna is usually covered with a plastics material for reasons of appearance and to protect it from impact, rain, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The user of the telephone may be near an external antenna, for example in an automobile vehicle. To be able to send/receive a signal of better quality, an orifice <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> houses a radio-frequency connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that can be connected to an external antenna of the vehicle via a coaxial cable. The connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to the transmitter of the telephone, enabling it to route call signals. The user generally employs a car kit which is fastened near the steering wheel and in which the telephone is conveniently placed. When the telephone is inserted in the car kit, an electrical connection is made between the connector and corresponding circuitry of the car kit, which circuitry is connected to a cable in turn connected to the antenna of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a fastening device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention. The device has a first branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a second branch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> longer than the first branch. The two branches are joined together at a common end <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and their respective other ends <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are free ends. The branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is designed to be coupled to the telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by means of a coupling sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the outside face of the free end of the branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and which is inserted in the orifice <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The sleeve is in the form of a hollow cylinder whose diameter is such that it can be inserted in the cylindrical orifice <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, covering the connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to protect it, as explained above. Of course, in other embodiments, not shown, coupling means other than the sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be envisaged, such as two half-moons, a plurality of arcs along the perimeter of a circle whose diameter is less than that of the orifice <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to enable them to be inserted into the orifice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The second branch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in a plane substantially parallel to the first branch over the length of the first branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and its remaining portion, as far as its free end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, is curved towards the branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is in substantially the same plane as the first branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus when the sleeve is inserted in the orifice, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the fabric of the user&apos;s shirt is inserted between the two branches, the end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> applies a clamping force to the fabric which presses it against the rear face of the telephone. The fabric is therefore clamped between the two branches and the back of the telephone and there is no risk of the telephone falling out of the pocket. The user can apply pressure in the opposite direction to release the fabric of the shirt. The clamping branch is designed to resist torsion effects as well as providing the clamping function. The device is molded in one piece from a plastics material, for example, which also means that it can be made by a single fabrication process. This is an additional advantage of the invention over the prior art, in which it was essential to fabricate the stopper separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> also has solid arcs <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on its inside face that faces towards the branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. These arcs make a positive contribution to the clamping force applied to the garment disposed between the two branches by reducing the gap between the free end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the rear face of the telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The fastening device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a retaining collar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the common end of the two branches to make a rigid connection between the device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the telephone. The user threads the collar over the top of the antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and pushes it down to the base of the antenna. Subsequent pressure on the back of the sleeve plugs the orifice <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and produces the combination shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, ready to be fastened to a garment or a belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiment described above. As explained above, the coupling means can be of any kind. The arcs <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the inside face of the free end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be replaced by any other means for reducing the gap between the end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the rear face of the telephone. Means can even be added to the end <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> so that it adheres to the fabric of a garment or to a belt. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to manually-operated sealing tools, and more particularly to a manually-operated sealing tool for joining the overlapped ends of plastic strapping, as well as to the seal member and the sealed joint formed upon the overlapped ends of the strapping by means of such tool effectively crimping the preformed seal member onto the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Manually-operated sealing tools for joining and sealing the overlapped ends of steel or plastic strapping are of course well-known and the state of the prior art is exemplified by means of U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,185 which was issued on Jan. 7, 1992 to Angarola, U.S. Pat. No. 3,333,607 which was issued on Aug. 1, 1967 to Haraden, U.S. Pat. No. 3,089,366 which was previously issued on May 14, 1963 to Haraden, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,680,979 which was issued on Jun. 15, 1954 to Childress. In addition, it is seen that U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,575 which was issued on May 5, 1992 to Angarola et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,636,592 which was issued on Jan. 25, 1972to Beach, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,237,256 which was issued on Mar. 1, 1966 to Young are also of interest for their disclosures of various sealed joints which are impressed or formed upon overlapped end portions of steel or plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While the aforenoted tools, particularly, for example, the tool such as that disclosed and illustrated within the patent issued to Childress, certainly operate satisfactorily in that they adequately perform clinching or crimping operations in connection with the mounting of seal members upon overlapped ends of strapping, the tools are relatively complex. In addition, and more importantly, while such tools can of course readily achieve their sealing functions, the resulting crimped seals, comprising the seal members and the overlapped ends of the strapping, are relatively flat or planar. Accordingly, the seals are relatively insecure in that the seals are subject to disengagement, that is, the overlapped ends of the strapping can become loosened with respect to each other, under the exertion of tensile loads because the flat or planar surfaces of the strapping ends can in effect slide or move with respect to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A need therefore exists in the art for a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool for sealing the overlapped ends of plastic strapping, as well as for a seal member to be used in conjunction with such tool, by means of a sealed joint which will effectively prevent the loosening or relative disengagement of the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping with respect to each other. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool, seal member, and sealed joint, for sealing together the overlapped ends of plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool, seal member, and sealed joint, for sealing together the overlapped ends of plastic strapping wherein such tool, seal member, and sealed joint effectively overcome the various drawbacks and operational disadvantages characteristic of the PRIOR ART. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool, seal member, and sealed joint, for sealing together the overlapped ends of plastic strapping wherein such tool is relatively simple in construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool, seal member, and sealed joint, for sealing together the overlapped ends of plastic strapping wherein such tool can effectively crimp the seal member upon the overlapped ends of the strapping such that the resulting sealed joint has a substantially undulated configuration whereby such sealed joint, comprising the crimped seal member and the overlapped ends of the strapping, effectively comprises a locked structure such that the overlapped ends of the strapping cannot become loosened or disengaged with respect to each other. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objectives are achieved in accordance with the teachings and principles of the present invention through the provision of a new and improved manually-operated sealing tool, seal member, and sealed joint, for sealing together the overlapped ends of plastic strapping wherein such tool can effectively crimp the seal member upon the overlapped ends of the strapping such that the resulting sealed joint has a substantially undulated configuration. In this manner, the sealed joint, comprising the crimped seal member and the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping, effectively comprises a locked structure such that the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping cannot become loosened or disengaged with respect to each other. The tool comprises a pair of manually-operated handles, an anvil, a pair of jaws operatively connected to the manually-operated handles, and a pair of side plates. The inner surfaces of the jaws comprise convex and concave portions, and the anvil member comprises in effect a central convex portion and a pair of recessed side portions. The side plates and anvil portions therefore define relative convex and concave portions which cooperate with the concave and convex portions of the inner surfaces of the jaws when the jaws are moved to their crimping positions. Consequently, the resulting locked structure, comprising the crimped seal member and the overlapped end portions of the plastic strapping, has an undulated configuration whereby loosening or disengagement of the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping is effectively prevented.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference continuing to be made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the sealing tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is seen to further comprise a pair of pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> wherein the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are adapted to be pivotally mounted upon the anvil member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and interposed between the oppositely disposed side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. More particularly, each one of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of axially spaced side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which are integrally connected together by means of a crimping jaw member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is integrally connected to first end portions of the side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a cross-piece <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is integrally connected to intermediate portions of the side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a result of such structure, a substantially rectangularly-shaped aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is defined within each pivotal jaw <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is adapted to house or accommodate a respective one of the end portions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the anvil member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The ends portions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are each respectively provided with a throughbore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and in a corresponding manner, the side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each one of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are respectively provided with apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are also respectively provided with apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a jaw pin <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is adapted to be passed through the apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of each side plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> defined within each pivotal jaw <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the throughbore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> defined within the anvil member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, with the opposite end portions of the jaw pin <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> being snap-fitted within the apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, so as to pivotally mount the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> upon the anvil member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and between the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is still further to be appreciated that the free end portions of the side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each pivotal jaw <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, along with each cross-piece <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, together define a clevis portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which is adapted to respectively house or accommodate the pivot portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of each handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More particularly, each one of the free end portions of the side frame members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided with an aperture <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, while the pivot portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided with throughbores <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In addition, in order to assemble such pivot portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the clevis portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, each assembly further includes a link pin <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which is passed through the clevis member apertures <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the pivot portion throughbores <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so as to pivotally retain the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> assembled with the handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As can readily be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, when the handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are pivoted with respect to the toggle pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to be disposed in their relatively opened position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the opposite ends of the toggle pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed at the upper ends of the slots, channels, or tracks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are pivoted around the jaw pins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> such that the clevis end portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are pivoted radially inwardly so as to be disposed adjacent to each other while the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are effectively pivoted radially outwardly so as to be relatively remote from each other and thereby disposed at relatively opened positions. The manually-operable tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is therefore readied for the initiation of a crimping operation whereby a seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be lockingly sealed upon overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of plastic strapping. Subsequently, when the handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are pivoted with respect to the toggle pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to be disposed in their relatively closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the opposite ends of the toggle pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed at the lower ends of the slots, channels, or tracks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are pivoted around the jaw pins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> such that the clevis end portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are pivoted radially outwardly so as to be disposed relatively remote from each other while the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are effectively pivoted radially inwardly so as to be moved toward each other to their relatively closed position. In this manner, the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> perform the crimping operation upon the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so as to lockingly engage or seal the same upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In connection with the particulars comprising the crimping operation so as to lockingly secure the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping, it is initially noted that a first embodiment of the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention is disclosed within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. It is noted that the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> comprises a three-sided structure which generally has the configuration of an inverted U and is seen to be defined by means of an upper member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and a pair of dependent side members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In addition, unlike the conventional seal member disclosed within the aforenoted U.S. Pat. No. 3,237,256 which was issued to Young on Mar. 1, 1966, the side members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are effectively disposed in a convergent mode with respect to each other as opposed to the divergent mode as disclosed within Young. This convergent mode of the side members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> enables the seal member, disposed around the overlapped ends of the plastic strapping, to be advantageously initially disposed or positioned within the manually-operable tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in preparation for the crimping operation to be performed upon the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so as to lockingly secure the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping. More particularly, as may best be appreciated from FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the lower edge portion of each one of the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a three-sided cut-out region <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which has a predetermined dimension wherein the cut-out regions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> cooperate together so as to in effect define an axially oriented channel <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, within which the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the overlapped ends <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping, can be longitudinally disposed. As can then be best appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can then engage the dependent sides <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so as to effectively move the dependent sides <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from their relatively opened position to their relatively closed position at which the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is then crimped upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As can also be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and in order to increase or enhance in effect the gripping force generated between the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the outer surfaces of the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping when the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is crimpingly locked upon the end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping, the interior surfaces of the seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be provided with a grit material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> similar to that disclosed within the aforenoted patent issued to Young. However, as disclosed within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> second embodiment of the seal member is disclosed and is denoted by the reference character <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> wherein in lieu of the grit material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the interior surfaces of the seal member <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may be provided with teeth members <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> which are similar to the teeth disclosed within U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,575 which was issued to Angarola et al. on May 5, 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference lastly being made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the formation of the sealed or crimped joint upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping, and the unique, new and improved structure of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention for forming such sealed or crimped joint, is disclosed. More particularly, it is seen that each cut-out region <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of each side plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comprises undersurface or bottom surface portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the central section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a first bottom or undersurface portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and each one of the side portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a second bottom or undersurface portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, as can best be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, 7A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the second undersurface portions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the side portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are in effect disposed at an elevational level which is raised, offset, or recessed with respect to, or above, the elevational level of the undersurface portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the side plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the first undersurface portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the central section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the undersurface region across the tool as considered in the axial direction has in effect an undulated configuration. In a similar manner, it is seen that the upper inner surface of each one of the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with a pair of axially spaced protrusions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which define third surface portions which are in effect axially aligned with the second undersurface portions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the side portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, while in effect a fourth depressed or recessed portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is defined at an axially central portion of each jaw member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the pivotal jaws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are moved to their full closed positions, the upwardly extending projections or protrusions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> will cooperate with the second undersurface portions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the side portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the recessed portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of each jaw member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will cooperate with the first undersurface portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the central section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the anvil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the undersurface portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the side plate recessed portions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will be disposed upon the sides of the jaw members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and at levels substantially coincident with the first surface portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> whereby as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the resulting crimped seal member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping are formed with an undulated configuration across the axial extent thereof so as to form the resulting joint <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This is significant because the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> therefore cannot be simply pulled apart when axially oriented tensile forces are impressed upon the overlapped end portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, it may be seen that in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention, a new and improved manually-operable crimping tool for lockingly securing a seal member upon overlapped end portions of plastic strapping has been developed and disclosed. The tool is provided with the particularly aforenoted structure such that the resulting crimped seal member and overlapped end portions of the plastic strapping have an undulated configuration whereby the overlapped end portions of the plastic strapping cannot readily become loosened or disengaged with respect to each other under the influence of axially applied tensile forces. The present invention is also directed toward the particularly structured or configured seal member as well as toward the resulting sealed joint formed or defined between the seal member and the overlapped end portions of the plastic strapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many variations and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to buckles and more particularly to buckles used with straps to secure loads to vehicles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Loads are often secured to vehicles by straps that use a buckle to allow the length of the strap to be adjusted. Load carrier straps are often used to secure heavy loads. The buckles must be sturdy and capable of reliably gripping a strap under high tension. Thus, buckles are typically made of metal which creates a risk of damaging the finish of a vehicle on which the strap is used. Metal buckles may also damage the finish on the load being secured by the strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,023,821 discloses a buckle cover adapted to slide over a buckle for protecting adjacent objects. Unfortunately, this cover interferes with normal use or adjustment of the buckle. The cover must be slid onto and off of the buckle with each use and is therefore cumbersome to use. The cover is also subject to being dislodged or inadvertently left off, leaving the metal buckle exposed. In addition, the cover is rather bulky and unstylish in appearance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention provides strap and buckling devices that combine rigid high-strength materials with elastomeric compressible materials in rugged, sturdy designs that are easy to use without damaging the surface of a vehicle or cargo carried on the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A buckle constructed according to the present invention is depicted generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a metal frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a metal cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes side plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and front and rear cross-members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Cross-members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> support side plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a spaced-apart rigid relationship to each other. Each side member includes at least one bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through which a cam pivot pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> fits. The cam pivot pin also passes through a bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivotally hold the cam in place relative to the side plates and front cross-member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> biases a front face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against front cross-member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes lever portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opposite the front face that a user depresses to move the front face away from cross-member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Cross-member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes serrations <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that cooperate with teeth <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed on front face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to grip strap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When the lever portion is depressed, the strap is free to move between the cam and the frame. When the lever is released, any tension on the strap in a first direction <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> pulls the front face toward the cross-member, thereby firmly pinching the strap and preventing movement. Tension on the strap in the other direction <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> pulls the cam face away from the cross-member, allowing the strap to be tightened, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A bumper, protector or cushion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed on each side plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The cushion is typically affixed to the side by overmolding. The cushion is typically made of a flexible or resilient material, for example TPE, that is soft enough to avoid damaging the surface of a vehicle or cargo being carried by the vehicle. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, pivot pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an enlarged portion head <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at each end. Heads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> help to mechanically retain the cushions on the frame of the buckle. The cushions may be interconnected by a bridge or web portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which further stabilizes the cushions on the buckle. When utilizing some thermoplastic elastomer materials that do not have direct adhesion to metal parts, it is generally necessary to provide for a mechanical interconnection between the elastomer and the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the cushions extend sufficiently above the side plates of the buckle to shield the cam lever from hitting an adjacent surface such as the surface of a vehicle or load. Although the cushion may not extend around the front or back of the frame, it projects outward sufficiently from the side plates to shield cross-members and other metal parts of the buckle from contact with the vehicle. The cushion is preferably thick and resilient enough to absorb impacts of the buckle on a vehicle without denting or damaging the surface of the vehicle. The cushions are typically formed of a thermoplastic elastomer material, for example, TPE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show an alternate buckle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Buckle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes structural components similar to those of buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference>, side plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> include auxiliary plates <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively. The auxiliary plates are mounted to the side plates on pillars <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, respectively. Preferably, the frame includes both side plates and auxiliary plates molded as a single unit. Cushions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are then overmolded onto the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Cam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a cushion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> disposed over the lever portion. Cushion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a depression <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that provides a comfortable location for a user to place their finger to operate the cam. In instances where the cam lever projects beyond the edges of the side plates and or side plate cushions, the cam cushion serves to provide additional protection against damage to the vehicle finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another buckle constructed according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Buckle <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> incorporates structural components similar to buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, side plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on buckle <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are formed with mushroom-shaped retainers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at the front and rear. The retainers provide a mechanical grip for cushions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In addition or alternatively, side plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may include one or more holes <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that allow a small amount <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of cushion material to flow through and form a mechanical connection to the side plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> illustrate another buckle constructed according to the present invention at <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Buckle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> incorporates a structural member similar to buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The main difference is that cushions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on buckle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are formed separately and attached to the structural member with rivets <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which pass through the front and rear cross-members. The cushions may also be connected by a piece of elastomer or web portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as with buckle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The various buckles as described herein are useful for attaching loads to vehicles, particularly to roof racks and rear mounted racks. One example of a roof-mounted device that is suitable for use with the disclosed buckles is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/280,504, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the disclosure set forth above encompasses multiple distinct inventions with independent utility. While each of these inventions has been disclosed in its preferred form, the specific embodiments thereof as disclosed and illustrated herein are not to be considered in a limiting sense as numerous variations are possible. The subject matter of the inventions includes all novel and non-obvious combinations and subcombinations of the various elements, features, functions and/or properties disclosed herein. Similarly, where the claims recite &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;a first&rdquo; element or the equivalent thereof, such claims should be understood to include incorporation of one or more such elements, neither requiring nor excluding two or more such elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In the fastener-chain-finishing apparatus, only a knockout among plural members arranged below a fastener-chain-transfer path of a space-forming unit can move up and down but all the other members are not movable. Consequently, the units below the chain-transfer path can be compact. Further, main bodies of movable grippers and a punch of the space-forming unit, which have a length equal to a space-forming length of the fastener chain and are arranged above the chain-transfer path, have end surfaces that are exposed outside and are flush with each other at least on a side of a stopper-attaching unit arranged adjacent to them. As a result, all the operating members of the space-forming unit can be arranged so as to contact with the stopper-attaching members of the stopper-attaching unit. Therefore, it is possible to form a space on the slide fastener chain to which particularly coil-shaped continuous coupling elements are attached by sewing thread, simultaneously with attachment of the stopper, which was conventionally impossible to achieve. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a finishing apparatus which is suitable particularly for a fastener chain to which a coil-shaped continuous synthetic resin elements are attached, by sewing, along a side edge of a fastener tape. More particularly, it relates to a finishing apparatus for fixing stoppers to the fastener chain in its length-wise direction at predetermined intervals and simultaneously removing a group of the elements with a predetermined length so as to form spaces at positions adjacent to the stopper attached positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a finishing apparatus for succesively attaching stoppers to a fastener chain transferred intermittently and for simultaneously forming spaces on the fastener chain successively, has been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-51819 or Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-18482 and reduced to practice. However, any of such finishing apparatuses is for finishing a fastener chain where metallic elements are attached to a fastener tape thereof, but is not for finishing a fastener chain where coil-shaped continuous fastener elements are attached to a fastener tape thereof by sewing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is necessary to have positions of the fastener chain where the stoppers are attached close to positions where the spaces are formed as close as possible. Therefore, the above-mentioned finishing apparatus includes a stopper-attaching unit and a space-forming unit arranged so as to be close to each other as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because an object to be processed is a fastener chain in which metallic elements have been planted, the stopper-attaching unit and the space-forming unit can be thus arranged so as to be close to each other so that the stopper attaching position and the space forming position in the fastener chain can be close to each other. However, in the case where a fastener chain where synthetic resin coupling elements formed into a continuous coil shape are sewn on a fastener tape thereof is processed, the above-mentioned finishing apparatus cannot be put into practical use only by changing its design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Namely, in the fastener chain having such kind of metallic coupling elements, the respective coupling elements are planted by caulking their leg portions onto the side edge of the fastener tape, and are made of metal that does not have viscosity and flexibility. As a result, the coupling elements can be removed from the fastener tape easily only by cutting one of the leg portions of each element. Naturally, that the coupling elements are cut to be removed from the fastener tape easily renders an element-cutting-removal mechanism so simple as disclosed in the above publications. For example, a basic element-cutting-removal mechanism for metallic elements represented by the mechanisms disclosed in the above publications is provided with a punch and a die for forming spaces that are respectively arranged above and below the fastener chain, which requires no other special operating members. Further, a transfer surface of the chain in the attached position of the die can be used as a die, so that only the punch may be operated up and down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as disclosed in the above publications, a stopper-attaching unit cuts a wire material transferred intermittently into a dimension of the stopper in a position above the stopper attaching position of the fastener chain and bends the wire material into U-shape, and presses the wire material from above astride of a row of the coupling elements of the fastener chain, and allows the wire material to pierce through a fastener tape and simultaneously bends its leg portions inwardly on a lower surfaces of the fastener tapes so as to fix the wire material to the fastener chain. Such operations are performed by synchronously cooperating up-and-down motion of a cutting punch, arranged above a fixed die formed on a base composing a fastener-chain-transfer path in the stopper-attaching unit, with forward-and-backward motion of a bender along the chain-transfer direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the space-forming unit, which forms a space by removing the metallic coupling elements from the fastener chain in a predetermined length thereof, and the stopper-attaching unit, which attaches the stopper to a position close to the space, are composed of a small number of operating members which perform a simple operation above the base composing the transfer surface of the fastener chain. Thus, it is not specially difficult to arrange both the units so close to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the fastener chain with the coil-shaped coupling elements made of synthetic resin attached to the fastener tapes thereof by sewing thread, if only coupling head portions of the elements are simply cut, the leg portions are still held by the sewing thread. Such removal of coupling elements are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-48521. This Publication discloses a space-forming unit including: a pair of upper fixed grippers spaced from each other in a lateral direction; a pair of lower movable grippers spaced from each other in the lateral direction, which are movable up and down with respect to the upper grippers and nip opposite fastener tapes of a fastener chain with the fastener elements facing upward, in cooperation with the upper fixed grippers when the lower grippers are lifted up; a fixed die arranged between the lower movable grippers and having a cutting edge portion at its upper portion thereof; a knockout for passing through the fixed die and moving up and down between the lower grippers and between the upper grippers; and a punch arranged above the knockout so as to face the knockout for pushing down the coupling head portions of the fastener elements at the time of being processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The space-forming unit having the above structure cuts and removes the coil-shaped continuous coupling elements from the fastener chain in such a manner as follows. After the opposite fastener tapes of the fastener chain are nipped by the upper grippers and lower grippers in a state where the coupling elements are coupled with each other and face upward, the coupling-head-portion-sides of the fastener elements are pushed down by the punch so as to be exposed between the fastener tapes to the cutting edge portion of the fixing die. When the punch is further lowered, the lower portions of the exposed coupling head portions of the opposite coupling elements are cut by the cutting edge portion of the fixed die which is in a stand-by position below the coupling head portions, and the cut fastener elements are pushed up as being nipped by the punch and the knockout, and residual portions of the cut elements are drawn out of loops of the sewing thread so as to be removed from the fastener tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to cut and remove the parts of such coil-shaped fastener elements made of synthetic resin from the fastener chain to which the fastener elements are attached by the sewing thread, it is necessary to arrange a plurality of operating members at positions above and below the transferring surface of the fastener chain, and to synchronously actuate these operating members so as to be co-operated with each other. For this reason, a driving section for actuating the operating members must be provided in or below the base. Further, there is a limit in compactly designing a lot of members and apparatuses arranged in such a manner, thus it is extremely difficult to provide all the members including supporting sections for the respective members within a dimensional limit of the operating members. Particularly since the lower grippers, in side of which the knockout moves up and down, needs to have a function for guiding the knockout inside thereof, the lower grippers are necessarily designed so as to surround a circumference of the knockout. As a result, the lower grippers are extended to an outer side a space-forming area of the slide fastener chain in the longitudinal direction thereof, which is determined by the dimension of the knockout. Thus, a distance between the space and the stopper becomes longer by this extended length, and thus the stopper-attaching unit cannot be installed so as to be close to the space-forming area. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in order to solve conventional problems, and its particular object is to provide a finishing apparatus where a space-forming unit and a stopper-attaching unit are arranged so that spaces can be formed in a fastener chain to which coil-shaped continuous coupling elements are attached and simultaneously stoppers can be attached to the fastener chain at positions close to the spaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The object can be achieved by a fastener-chain-finishing apparatus, comprising: a chain-supply means for intermittently supplying a continuous fastener chain in which a pair of rows of coupling elements in a coil shape are attached along inner side edges of a pair of opposite fastener tapes by sewing; a stopper-attaching unit which is arranged on a transfer path of the fastener chain and fixes stoppers to the supplied fastener chain at a predetermined interval; and a space-forming unit which is arranged adjacent to the stopper-attaching unit at the transfer path of the fastener chain and removes the coupling elements of a predetermined length from the fastener chain, wherein the stopper-attaching unit includes a forming die arranged on a base and composing one part of the fastener-chain-transfer path, a bender for advancing and retreating along the fastener chain with respect to a supporting portion of a wire material for forming stoppers, and cutting punches for cutting the wire material supplied onto the bender into a predetermined length and a shape, a forming punch arranged so as to face the forming die for moving up and down with respect to the forming die so that a cut wire material piece can be formed into a stopper shape and for simultaneously installing the stopper to the fastener chain, the space-forming unit includes a pair of fixed grippers fixed to a base, spaced from each other in a lateral direction of the fastener-chain-transfer path and composing a part of the fastener-chain-transfer path, a pair of movable grippers spaced from each other in the lateral direction and being movable up and down with respect to the fastener-chain-transfer path in cooperation with each other, a pair of opposite fixed fixed cutters arranged between the pair of opposite fixed grippers and having cutting edge portions at their upper portions, a knockout for passing through the opposite fixed cutters and moving up and down between the fixed grippers and between the movable grippers, and a punch arranged so as to face the knockout and being movable up and down independently between the opposite movable grippers so as to push down coupling head portions of the coupling elements at the time of processing, and wherein all the lengths of respective members, namely, the fixed grippers, the movable grippers, the fixed cutters, the knockout and the punch in a direction of the fastener-chain-transfer path are set to be substantially equal to a length dimension of a space-forming area of the fastener chain, and end surfaces of those members at least on one side thereof share common vertical surfaces with one-side end surfaces of the stopper-attaching unit adjacent to the members in the direction of the chain-transfer path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Namely, according to the fastener-chain-finishing apparatus of the present invention, particularly in the space-forming unit, only the knockout among the plural members arranged below the chain-transfer path is movable up and down but all the other members are fixed in their positions so as not to move. As a result, excessive units for driving the members are not required, and thus the units below the chain-transfer path can be compact. Meanwhile, since the movable grippers and punch main body, which have lengths substantially equal to the space-forming length of the fastener chain, have end surfaces at least one side in the chain-transfer direction that are exposed outside, the end surfaces can come to contact with the end surface of the stopper-attaching unit arranged adjacent to them. Therefore, different from the conventional mechanism for cutting and removing metallic coupling elements in a space-forming area of the fastener chain, a stopper and a space can be simultaneously and accurately formed in a predetermined positions in the fastener chain to which coil-shaped coupling elements are attached by sewing thread, in spite that it needs a complicated structure and a lot of operating members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is preferable that the opposite movable grippers and the punch of the space-forming unit respectively have slide lever sections for moving up and down along inner wall surfaces of a cylindrical guide member having an end surface at a side of the vertical surfaces, and gripper main bodies and a punch main body that are respectively joined perpendicularly to lower ends of the lever sections and are extended to end surfaces of the vertical surface side. Further preferably, the cutting punches of the stopper-attaching unit are provided to be slidable against the end surface of the cylindrical guide member at the vertical surface side. Furthermore, it is preferable that the slide lever sections of the movable grippers have angular cylindrical shapes where their upper ends are opened, and lower ends of springs are fixed in hollows of the slide lever sections, and upper ends of the springs are fixed to a retainer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further preferably, the cylindrical guide member of the space-forming unit and the cutting punches of the stopper-attaching unit are actuated by one fluid pressure cylinder. In this case, the stopper-attaching unit and the space-forming unit can be easily driven synchronously, and the units can be further compact. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> are structural views schematically showing a main section of the fastener-chain-finishing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The illustrated embodiment is only a most suitable and particular example, and various modification can be made by a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention comprises: a chain-supply unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for intermittently transferring a long fastener chain C, per predetermined length, to which opposite continuous coupling elements E in a coil shape are attached along confronting side edges of a pair of opposite fastener tapes T of the slide fastener chain C by means of sewing thread; a stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is arranged on a transfer path of the fastener chain C and fixes a stopper S to the supplied fastener chain C at predetermined intervals; and a space-forming unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is arranged in the transfer path of the fastener chain C at a position close to the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and removes the coupling elements E of a predetermined length from the fastener chain C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The chain-supply unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not necessarily have include a structure peculiar to the present invention, so may be a transfer means having a known mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> block-shaped forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> composing a part of the fastener-chain-transfer path is fixed to a base <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Just above the forming die, a wire material W for forming stoppers S, which is supplied intermittently and perpendicularly to the fastener chain C, is supported on a bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of a substantially rectangular cross section, which is arranged along the fastener chain C, facing a supporting portion of the wire material W so as to be movable forward and backward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Moreover, cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which cut the wire material W supplied across an upper surface of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into a length and a form required for the stopper S, are arranged so as to be movable up and down with the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> nipped therebtween. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> move down and cut the wire material W to be a wire material piece W&prime; and simultaneously bend the wire material piece W&prime; on the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into a substantially U shape. At this time, the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is lowered together with the cutting punches to press the cut wire material piece W&prime; from above and to form it into a stopper shape on the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fix it to a stopper-attaching position of the fastener chain C. During this lowering of the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> retreats from the supporting position of the wire material W. An upper surface of the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed into a hill-like shape, and a plurality of ribs are projected from its slanted surface along a transfer direction of the fastener chain C. Moreover, the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is provided so as to be movable up and down between the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with respect to the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not essentially different from the conventional mechanism, and further an interlocking mechanism of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is essentially the same as the mechanism disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-51819, for example. However, the mechanism in the present embodiment is different from that in the above-mentioned publication in that the operation of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is directly interlocked with the operation of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a cam mechanism. This interlocking mechanism will be described below in detail based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are lowered to cut the wire material W, so that the stopper S with a constant length whose both ends are sharpened in a fork shape are obtained. At the time of this cutting, a non-illustrated wire-material-guiding portion, which is incorporated into the column <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a part of the column <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, serves as a die. After the wire material W is cut, the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are further lowered, and the opposite cutting edge portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>bend both ends of the wire material piece WI around the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so as to form it into a U shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Upper portions which are about {fraction (1/3)} of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are respectively composed of plate-shaped blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are extended towards an introducing side of the fastener chain C. The blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are connected with each other by two links <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Further, a first plate cam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a cam surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which guides a connected node portion of the links <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, is arranged at a chain-upstream side of the links <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the cam surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>faces the connected node portion of the links <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a second plate cam <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> having a cam surface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the chain-upstream side is arranged extending from the plate-shaped blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the lower ends of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the column <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, an upper end of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is pivotally supported to a part of the column <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via a shaft so as to confront with the cam surface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second plate cam <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The cam contact surface of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is urged in one direction by a non-illustrated urging means, so that the cam contact surface contacts with the cam surface of the second plate cam <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is composed of a plate material having a substantially boot-shaped, and its toe portion moves into and out of an intermediate between the pair of the cutting edge portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by the pivotal movement of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> composes a support bent portion of the wire material piece W&prime;. Moreover, the cam contact surface of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is composed of a plurality of continuous bent surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Here, the stopper S of the present embodiment can be attached to the stopper-attaching position of the fastener chain C by cutting and bending the wire material W into a substantially U shape and by fixing it by means of the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. a material, which is previously formed to be a stopper S bent into a substantially U shape, may be supplied and fixed by the forming die. In this case, the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The space-forming unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is the most characteristic part of the present invention. The unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, fixed cutters <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a knockout <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Its peculiar structure makes it possible to form a space in the coil-shaped continuous coupling elements E, simultaneously with the attachment of the stopper S by cooperation with the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The above structure will be described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Their end surfaces of these members on one side are flush with each other in such a manner that they contact with the adjacent end surfaces of the base <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> as well as the base <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The knockout <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, which is an only variable member among these members, can be moved up and down by a ram <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> arranged on a floor section and compression springs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are housed in an inner hollow section of a cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for guiding and holding the grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> up and down. The paired opposite movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> have identical reversed T shapes, and each of their slide lever sections <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is in a shape of a hollowed rectancular. a gripper main body made of a substantially rectangular parallelepiped solid having a dimension equal to the length dimension of the space is provided perpendicularly to each of lower ends of the slide lever sections <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Moreover, the cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> has a U-shaped cross section, and for its opening surface at a short side thereof, the column end surface, which is flush with the end surfaces of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, serves as one guide surface of the cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A maximum length of long sides of the guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is set equal to the length dimension of the space. Meanwhile, a cross section of the slide lever section <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a substantially square frame shape, and the two slide lever sections <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are inserted from lower ends of the cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> into the inner hollow portions thereof, with the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> nipped therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> made of a plate material is also formed into a reverse T shape which is the same as the shape of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and it is composed of a slide lever section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a punch main body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is arranged between the paired opposite movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. When their slide lever sections <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are inserted into the hollow portions of the cylindrical guide members <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> from the lower ends thereof, the respective gripper main bodies and the punch main body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are exposed outside from the lower ends of the cylindrical guide members <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and their forward and backward end surfaces in the chain-transfer direction are flush with the forward and backward end surfaces of the cylindrical guide members <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, upper ends of the paired compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are fixed to a retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> having a single cubic shape, while lower ends of the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are fixed to bottom surfaces of the hollow portions of the slide lever sections <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Meanwhile, slits <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for lowering and guiding the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance are formed on upper portions of the facing side walls of the cylindrical guide members <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A stop arm which is elastically urged from above is horizontally inserted into the slit <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on a chain-downstream side of the slits <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>When an external force is not applied to the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> from above, the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is supported from below in a fixed position by the stop arm. At this time, the gripper main bodies of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are positioned above the base <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with a space for allowing the stopper of the fastener chain C to pass remained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> With such a structure of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the fluid pressure cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is actuated to push down the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is lowered, and the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are also lowered by elastic forces of the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. When the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> come to contact with the surface of the fastener chain C below and the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are compressed, the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> come to hold the opposite fastener tapes T between the fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the movable grippers by means of the elastic forces of the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further moves down to push the head portions of the coupling elements E against the fixed cutters <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> below so as to cut the leg portions of the coupling elements E in an area equal to the length dimension of the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, it is possible to make the one end surface of the space-forming unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> brought into contact with the one end surface of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the same vertical surface, which is the most important characteristic in the present invention. In other words, as is understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the end surfaces of the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the column <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are arranged so as to correspondingly contact with the end surfaces of the fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>.

Even when the cutting and bending of the stopper wire material W are completed, the lowering of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is maintained. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> just when the bending is completed, the contact surface of the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with the second cam surface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is changed, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the bender <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is rotated fulcruming its upper end so that the bender main body <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>retreats from the wire material supporting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Even after the bender main body <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>retreats, the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are further lowered until they come into contact with the upper surface of the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the fastener chain C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). When the lower end slanted surfaces of the cutting punches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> come in contact with the fastener chain C stopping on the upper surface of the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the contact surface of the connected node portion of the two links <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with the cam surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first plate cam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is changed so that the connected node portion is greatly bent as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As a result, only the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is further lowered via the driving block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. When the forming punch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is lowered, both the bent ends of the wire material piece W&prime; astride of the coupling elements E pierces the fastener tape T and are bent inwardly by a bending portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the forming die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the back surface of the fastener chain C, thus the stopper S is fixed to the tape (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At the same time when the stopper S is attached to the fastener chain C in such a manner, a space is formed by the space-forming unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at a position close to the attaching position of the stopper S. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 11</cross-reference> show the steps of forming the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a state in which the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are standing by in an upper position where the fastener chain C stopping on the upper surface of the fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the coupling elements E. In this state, when the fluid pressure cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> starts to operate (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), a rod end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pushes down the upper surface of the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> so as to lower the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, without compressing the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> until the surfaces of the gripper main bodies of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are fitted on the surfaces of the fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the fastener chain C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). At this time, the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is also pushed to be lowered together with the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> by the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the lowering of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is completed, the compression springs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are compressed by the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, so that the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> strongly hold the opposite fastener tapes T between the fixed grippers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> by means of the elastic force. Even during this holding, the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> maintains to lower to press the head portions of the coupling elements E against the fixed cutters <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> below and cut the lower leg portions of the coupling elements E in an area equal to the length dimension of the space (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the cutting of the lower leg portions of the coupling element E is completed, the ram <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> arranged on the floor section is lifted to ascend the knockout <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and the cut coupling element pieces E are nipped between the lower end of the punch <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> standing by above and the knockout <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> below. Thereafter, the fluid pressure cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is actuated in its contracting/extending direction, synchronously with the ram <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, so that the retainer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is lifted to finally pull up the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the cut coupling element pieces E&prime; are drawn out of the sewing thread (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Thereafter, the coupling element pieces E&prime; are attracted to be removed from the apparatus by a known element-attracting means. Then, the ram <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is returned to its standby position by the elastic forces of the compression springs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the above description, according to the fastener-chain-finishing apparatus of the present invention, only the knockout <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the plural members provided below the chain-transfer path of the space-forming unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be moved up and down, and all the other members are fixed so that the units below the chain-transfer path can become compact. Further, in the main bodies of the movable grippers <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and punches <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which have a length substantially equal to the length of the space, are arranged above the chain-transfer path, their end surfaces at least on the side of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provided adjacently thereto are exposed outside and the exposed surfaces are flush with each other. As a result, the space-forming members can be arranged close to the stopper-attaching members of the stopper-attaching unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, so that the space can be formed in a predetermined portion of the fastener chain C to which coil-shaped continuous coupling elements are attached via by sewing thread approximately simultaneously with the attachment of the stopper S, which was impossible to achieve in the prior art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a continuous riveter for continuously ejecting blind rivets that effect the caulking on metal plates and so on (the blind rivet being hereafter referred to as a rivet). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The typical continuous riveter includes one that is disclosed by Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 7-236936 (Title of the Invention: &ldquo;Riveter&rdquo;) and shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and another prior thereto that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> show a state where a shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rivet R is held in a continuous riveter to insert a head R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a hole of a metal plate H, which is followed by &ldquo;caulking&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> jaw case piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is raised to move a jaw case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upwardly, whereby the pair of jaw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is biased to the lower part by springs via the jaw pusher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The jaw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> glides to the lower part of the tapered surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) of the jaw case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to thereby come close to each other and is raised upwardly by clamping the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rivet R (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the jaw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> clamps the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and moves upwardly, so that &ldquo;caulking&rdquo; is conducted with the raise of the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the head R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is held at the tip end of the nose piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut off from the head portion R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when a nose piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is raised, a cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is raised together with a nose piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly away from the metal plate H. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is vacuum-collected into a shank accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a vacuum ejector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the jaw case piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the nose piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are moved up to their upper dead points. Therefore, the nose piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly above a next shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> At this time, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>a which is connected to a feeding hole T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a blind rivet holder T, pulls out the blind rivet holder T, which has been moving forward by the piston <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tape air cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, from the accommodation case <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to move it for one shank, and sets the tip end of the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on top of the axis at the lower part of the nose piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described above, after caulking one shank, the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is moved downwardly with the jaw case <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to caulk the next shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The continuous riveter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is designed such that the nose piece <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is separated, but the structure of &ldquo;caulking&rdquo; is the same as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The structure of &ldquo;caulking&rdquo; of the present invention is the same as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the above, a distance between the rivets R is required to be set so as not to hinder the lowering movement of the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an explanatory view, which is a side view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> show a &ldquo;blind rivet holder&rdquo; which is registered as Japanese Utility Model Registration No. 3028739 by the present applicant before this application. This blind rivet holder is designed such that the rear portion of the riveter can be held upwardly to ease the rivet ejecting operation. Further, in order to increase the number of the rivets R held in an elongated plastic member T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which forms the blind rivet holder T, the rivets R are supported by the upper and lower tabs T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> respectively not in an perpendicular direction with respect to the longitudinal direction of the elongated plastic member T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> but in an inclined direction. Even if the continuous riveters shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are modified to use the blind rivet holder T, a rivet distance is required where the lowering movement of the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is not hindered as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional continuous riveters need to set the rivet R distance in the blind rivet holder T to be such rivet distance as to avoid hindering the lowering movement of the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the riveters suffer from a problem in that the large number of rivets R can not be accommodated in the accommodation case <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawing attached hereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a bottom view of a continuous riveter according to the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the continuous riveter as viewed in the arrow A-A direction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a side view of the continuous riveter, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the guide plate portion. The same components in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are denoted with the same referential numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> elongated from an accommodation case <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a rivet supply section C is provided with a bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>b which is bent in at a predetermined angle &bgr; with respect to the direction of a perpendicular section T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a blind rivet holder T through a linear feed section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a predetermined length. The bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is provided with a pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that presses and guides the perpendicular section T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the blind rivet holder T along the guide face from the linear feed section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The end section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a side where the blind rivet holder T of the pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> enters, and is widened open in a taper form in the direction so that the blind rivet holder T can enter readily. With this pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the blind rivet holder T which is sent out linearly, will be surely guided and bent from the linear fees section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is for guiding the blind rivet holder T and is provided with guide walls <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>. The blind rivet holder T is made to move without coming off the guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Further, in the linear feed section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, there is a long hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that linearly moves back and forth the feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and by this long hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> the tip end of the feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is protruded. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (also refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), the feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to the piston <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tape air cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and by this tape air cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> it moves linearly back and forth. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to a feeding hole T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the blind rivet holder T, and sends out one blind rivet holder T by linearly forward movement of the feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> show the steps of use in the guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> portion. First, from the situation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one blind rivet holder T is sent out as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> by the feeding claw <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Then, the blind rivet holder T enters under the pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to move, so that it bends along the bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the guide plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. At this time, the tip end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is widened open in a taper form, so that the perpendicular section T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the blind rivet holder T is always entered and guided under the pressing plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the shank R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rivet R immediately after it has been bent is disposed to correspond to the axis of the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the nose piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the continuous riveter is operated and &ldquo;caulking&rdquo; is conducted. At this time, since the blind rivet holder T is bent, a distance L can be defined between the upper and lower tabs T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which has passed the linear feed section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and immediately after they have been bent as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the upper and lower tabs T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the linear feed section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>immediately before they have been bent. Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the lowering cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is free from the abutment with the upper and lower tabs T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> immediately before they have been bent, and thus the distance between the rivets R can be set as small as possible as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further, since the upper and lower tabs T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the bent section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>do not have any rivets R since the rivets R have been consumed, they do not hinder the lowering movement of the cylinder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the positions of the upper tab T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lower tab T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the blind rivet holder T are shifted, and the rivet R is not made perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal direction of the blind rivet holder T but is inclined at an angle &agr;. Note that the perpendicular arrangement as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be employed in place of this inclined arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention as described above in detail has the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> (1) The continuous riveter constructed according to the present invention can make the rivet distance (pitch) in the blind rivet holder small, so that a larger number of the rivets can be accommodated within the accommodation case in comparison with the conventional riveter. Therefore, the number of times in which the blind rivet holder is replaced with a new one at the working site can be reduced, thereby improving the working efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (2) Since the shorter blind rivet holder (elongated plastic member) can hold the same number of rivets, the cost can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (3) The bent section of the guide plate is provided with pressing plates for pressing and guiding the perpendicular section of the blind rivet holder. Therefore, the blind rivet holder sent out linearly is certainly bent along the bent section of the guide plate, and the interval between the upper and lower tabs is certainly widened. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a first component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. First component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of a rigid material, in this case steel, and includes a projection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the form of a barb having a ramp surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a retention surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. First component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes an abutment surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the barb <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and abutment surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> face in opposite directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Second component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of a plastics material and includes a plastics engagement surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a ramp portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further includes a further abutment surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that further abutment surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> faces plastics engagement surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and ramp portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and defines a recess <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The components are assembled together by moving the first and second components in the direction of arrows F relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the distance E between the upper edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A of abutment surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the upper edge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A of ramp surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is less than the distance D between the lower edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of further abutment surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A of ramp portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus initial entry of the first component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the recess <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not restricted and furthermore is guided by ramp surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in engagement with ramp portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the distance B between the plastics engagement surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the further abutment surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is less than the distance C between the abutment surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and barb edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A. Thus progressive engagement between the first and second components causes the plastics engagement surface to plastically deform around the relatively rigid barb <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> since the distances B and C provide for an interference fit between the first and second components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Once the first and second components are fully engaged, in this case wherein top surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first component lies flush with surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the second component, the assembly is left to stand for a predetermined time, typically <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> hours. During this predetermined time period the plastics material of the plastics engagement surface in the vicinity of the barb edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A is under a stressed condition and tends to relax and creep away from barb edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A. Some material will creep along the ramp surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and other material will creep behind the retention surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In particular that material that creeps behind the retention surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> tends to increase the force required to disengage components in the direction of arrows G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> there is shown further first and second components <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, having features labeled <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> greater than those features which perform the same function on first and second components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this case the abutment surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in the form of a barb <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which faces barb <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Barbs <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> define a recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore the second component includes a boss <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which includes a plastics engagement surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which faces away from the further abutment surface <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> also included on the boss <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this case the first component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a steel mounting plate of a door latch and the second component <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a plastics housing of a door latch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> First component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made from sheet metal having a first surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In this case tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are bent upwardly and the edges of tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> provide for barbs <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In particular it can be seen that barb <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> lies in the plane defined by tab <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and barb <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> lies in the plane defined by tab <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Furthermore the planes defined by tabs and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are coincident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> During assembly of the first and second components, the boss <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> applies a separating force to the tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. However, the tabs remain substantially fixed relative to the main body portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A of component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by virtue of the thickness T of the sheet metal material and by virtue of the width W of the tabs. Thus tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are substantially rigid and substantially do not act in a resilient manner. In particular by providing the barbs in the plane of the tabs this provides for a particular rigid arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Consideration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the first component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second component <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in a fully assembled condition and progressively, over time, plastics material proximal barbs <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> creeps in the direction of arrows H along the ramp surfaces of barbs <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and also creeps in the direction of arrows J behind the retention surfaces of barbs <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that it is that material that creeps in the direction of arrows J that effectively increases the interference fit between the first and second components and therefore increases the force required to separate the components in the direction of arrows G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The applicant is the first to realize that this progressive creeping with time of the plastics material can be utilized to increase a retention force of two components. Thus by providing a suitable time period wherein this creep can take place, when the two components are subsequently used and subjected to pull away forces, the components will remain attached when subject to higher pull away forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description is exemplary and not just a material specification. The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and should be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. The preferred embodiments of this invention have been disclosed, however, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that certain modifications are within the scope of this invention. It is understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A workpiece changing system capable of automatically changing a heavy workpiece using a robot. A jig for attaching a workpiece thereto is mounted on a jig mounting device. The jig mounting device comprises a jig mounting unit having a rotary member and a swing member. The rotary member rotates the jig and the workpiece on the jig and hold them at a desired rotary position. The tilting member swings around an axis to tilt the jig and the workpiece on the jig and hold them at a desired tilting position. As the jig and the workpiece on the jig can take a suitable orientation or posture for being handled by the handling robot, the handling robot can hold a heavy workpiece without exerting excessive load on the robot wrist. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a workpiece changing system for changing workpieces for machining by a machine tool, etc., using a robot for handling a workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As a method of mounting an un-machined workpiece or a partly machined workpiece on a jig, there is known a method in which male screws are inserted into female screws formed on the workpiece from behind of the jig and brought into engagement with the female screws to fix the workpiece on the jig by threaded engagement of the screws. Since positions of the female screws formed on a workpiece are different depending on a king of product to be obtained, the mounting of a workpiece on the jig has to be performed manually and thus it has been hardly possible to change a workpiece by a robot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of handling a heavy workpiece by a robot, large moment is applied to joint axes of a robot wrist when the robot wrist changes its orientation. Since load capability of the joint axes of the robot wrist is relatively small with respect to the joint axes of the other parts of the robot, it is not desirable to change orientation of the robot wrist with the heavy workpiece held thereon. It has been required to change the orientation of the robot wrist in mounting and dismounting a workpiece on the jig by a robot, and therefore it has been difficult to adopt a robot for changing the heavy workpiece on the jig. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to enable automatic attaching and detaching of a heavy workpiece on a jig using a robot. Further, the present invention enables automatic clamping and unclamping of a workpiece on a jig by a robot to realize a full automatic operation of changing workpieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A workpiece changing system of the present invention is for attaching a workpiece to be machined on a jig and/or detaching a machined workpiece from the jig by holing the workpiece with a robot hand attached to a handling robot, and comprises: a jig mounting device including a mounting unit on which the jig is mounted; fixing means for fixing the jig on the mounting unit; and orientation changing means for changing an orientation of the jig on the mounting unit so that an orientation of the jig conforms with an orientation of the workpiece held or to be held by the robot hand in attaching/detaching of the workpiece on/from the jig. The orientation changing means may comprise rotating means for rotating the jig mounting unit and tilting means for tilting the jig mounting unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The workpiece changing system may further comprise: a pull bolt attaching/detaching robot having a pull bolt attaching/detaching device for attaching/detaching pull bolts on/from the workpiece by threaded engagement with threaded holes formed on the workpiece, the workpiece with the pull bolts attached being positioned on the jig by the handling robot, a pulling hydraulic cylinder device with a position arranged at said jig; a ball lock mechanism connected to the piston of the pulling hydraulic cylinder device for locking a distal end of the pull bolt, whereby the workpiece is fixed and positioned on the jig by a hydraulic pulling force of the piston. Thus, the attachment/detachment of the workpiece on/from the jig is automatically performed. The pull bolt attaching/detaching device may comprise a holding mechanism for holding a pull bolt, an engaging member to be engaged with the pull bolt held by said holding mechanism so as to transmit a rotational torque to the pull bolt, and a pushing mechanism for pushing the engaging member to be engaged with the pull bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The workpiece changing system of the present invention may further comprise an automatic storehouse for storing workpieces to be machined and machined workpieces, and in this case the handling robot may handle a workpiece to be machined taken out from the storehouse to attach the workpiece on the jig mounted on the jig mounting device, and handle the machined workpiece to detach the machined workpiece from the jig mounted on the jig mounting device and transfer the machined workpiece to the automatic storehouse to be automatically stored therein. Also, the handling robot may handle a workpiece to be machined taken out from the storehouse to attach the workpiece on the jig mounted on the jig mounting device in cooperation with the pull bolt attaching/detaching robot</paragraph>

Thus, automatic changing of workpieces can be achieved. Further, adopting full bolts for fixing and positioning the workpiece on the jig realizes a full automatic operation of attaching/detaching the workpiece on/from the jig. Furthermore, the present invention provide a full automatic workpiece changing system in which a machined workpiece is automatically changed for a workpiece to be machined by employing the pull bolt attaching/detaching robot and the automatic storehouse. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for preparing a contact surface of an implantable bone, joint or similar prosthetic component subject to contact or motion includes the steps of mounting the prosthetic component on a turning or cutting machine and cutting the face of the prosthetic component with a diamond cutting tool using computerized control of tool position along a cross direction to machine cut a super finished surface. The diamond cutting tool has a precise contact point and is shaped with a waviness under about 0.5 micrometers effective to cut a surface profile free of visible tool marks. As cut, the variations of contour and the surface roughness are both under about 0.5 micrometers, and preferably under about 0.2 micrometers or less. Upon implantation, the super finished surface generates wear particles at an asymptotically low or residual level during wear-in which may enhance wear characteristics and reduce local reaction or systemic rejection effects. The component is preferably formed by a strong hard polymer, such as UHMWPE, and may be a cup, liner, stem, head, tray, insert shell or other wear surface element of an implantable joint assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to the surface finishing of implantable prosthetic components. More particularly, the invention relates to surface finishing of an articulating or contacting surface of a polymeric orthopedic prosthesis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Those in the art have generally utilized, in conjunction with prosthetic implantation surgeries, components that have varying surface roughness characteristics. For example, it is currently common in the art for components such as liners, cups, stems, heads, trays and shells to be implanted in a human body with polished or as-machined surface finishes wherein machine lines or feed lines on the component(s) are visible to the unaided eye. These surface texture or roughness characteristics tend to produce wear debris that is shed from the components during a &ldquo;breaking-in&rdquo; or &ldquo;wearing-in&rdquo; period that occurs due to, for example, micromotion at a shell to liner interface, or due to articulation at a liner to head interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When quantities of wear debris are generated and accumulate in an implanted prosthesis, problems may arise that compromise the longevity and/or integrity of the implanted component(s) or the entire implanted prothesis. Among these problems is the possibility of a component or components becoming loosened which, in turn, could render the component(s) or the entire prosthesis ineffective for its intended purpose, or which could cause fracture of the affected implanted component(s) or prosthesis. Other problems which could occur are local inflammation or tissue reactions, or the resorption of the bone(s) surrounding, or in the vicinity of, the implanted prosthesis. Such bone resorption could, in turn, prematurely necessitate the total replacement of the entire prosthesis via revision surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Several previous attempts have been made to limit the amount of wear debris produced as a result of the &ldquo;breaking in&rdquo; or &ldquo;wearing-in&rdquo; of components due to, among other things, micromotion and/or articulation. These attempts have focused on attempting to produce components with higher quality finishes that have less surface roughness. For example, some in the art have performed supplemental hot pressing of the polymeric components to be used in connection with prosthetic implantation surgeries in order to improve the surface finish of those components. Such supplemental hot pressing, however, has detrimental effects on the microstructure of the pressed components, and may cause delamination of articulating surfaces of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene implantation components. Other approaches in the art have either not been able to produce components with higher quality finishes or have produced such components only with accompanying drawbacks to the performance and/or structure of the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists in the art for non-specialized components that have improved finishes for use in prosthetic implantation surgeries. In particular, there is a need for finished components that have a surface that reduces or substantially eliminates the formation of wear debris when the surface is subjected to contact or motion, while not adversely affecting the microstructure of the components, and which otherwise maintains beneficial aspects of prior art implantation components. A need also exists for a method to prepare such components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a finished implantable polymeric prosthetic joint or bone component having a superior surface finish, or &ldquo;super finish&rdquo;, and a method for fabricating the component. The joint or bone component can be a cup, shell, tray insert, stem, liner or head, or other component which has a face that, once implanted or during implantation, is a surface which is to be subjected to a surface-to-surface contact, or motion. The joint or bone component is prepared by subjecting the component to a turning movement against a surface cutting tool such that the component has a circularly symmetric or radially symmetric finish region with an as-machined cut surface finish substantially smoother than about 0.5 micrometers. The joint or bone component, once prepared in accordance with the present invention, has a visually smooth contact region and is matable with a similarly contoured implant component for sliding or micromovement therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the implantable polymeric prosthetic joint or bone component has a two-dimensional surface contour with an as-machined surface profile in a cross direction with peak to valley surface smoothness effective to achieve in vivo particle generation at a residual (e.g., asymptotically flat) level or rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also provided by the present invention is a method of preparing the implantable prosthetic joint or bone component. The method comprises the steps of placing the component in a mounting, such as a chuck or collet, on a turning machine, such as a lathe, for rotation against a replaceable or resharpenable cutting tool, and rotationally cutting the face of the component with a diamond cutting tool having a predetermined shape, geometry and sharpness effective to form a cut surface contour with waviness under 0.5 micrometers. The cutting tool may be brazed into a tool tip insert such as a steel or carbide tip insert, or clamped onto a tool holder for indexable tooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, once mounted, the component is rotated while the cutting tool is fed across a controlled R, X &amp; Z feed path one or more times, with each time constituting one &ldquo;pass.&rdquo; Each pass removes material from the surface of the component, and the diamond cutter tool path forms a final profile. During the turning of the component by the cutting tool, the position of the cutting tool and/or the total number of passes of the cutting tool may be controlled by computer. The method of the present invention also contemplates steps of cooling the cutting edge of the tool and/or removing swarf while the cutting of the component occurs. The method concludes when the surface attains the desired shape, with a surface finish substantially smoother than 0.5 micrometers and a variation of contour waviness less than or equal to 0.5 micrometers. The method of the present invention preferably provides a smooth surface finish with excursions or variations from a nominal flat or curved surface profile lying below a threshold which is 0.05 and 0.10 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the method of preparing the implantable prosthetic joint or bone component, the cutting tool may be rotated to fly cut a surface of the component while it is held stationary or translated. In still further embodiments, the turning machine carries the component on an air-bearing, and the tool compound may operate with air or hydrostatic slides and damping to minimize vibration, or to prevent transfer of vibrational artifacts to the surface finish of the component.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A process for preparing an implant component in accordance with the present invention is shown in the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For the first step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the process, an implant component is mounted on a machine such as a turning lathe. Suitable implant components for mounting include a joint or bone prosthesis component such as a cup, shell, tray, stem, liner or head or any other implant component which has a face that possesses radial symmetry in a region, and that is a flat or curved surface which is to be subjected to contact or motion once implanted or during implantation. Particularly suitable implant components are those made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and include, but are not limited to, acetabular liners for hip prostheses and tibial trays, stems of tibial plateaus for knee prostheses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Suitable turning machines include horizontal or vertical lathes and, in particular, a horizontal, chucking-type turret lathe which accommodates one or more surface cutting tools. Milling machines or mill/turning machines may also be used for the practice of the invention. The machine may be adapted to operate with air bearings to move effectively isolate the implant component from mechanical vibration during the machining process. Preferably, a turning machine is used that is adapted with air bearings and allows for a positioning tolerance of within 0.005 millimeters, with an electronic feed with ball screws to effectively eliminate backlash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The implant component is mounted via means capable of firmly grasping and holding, but not deforming, implant components that are made of various materials and have various dimensions. Some of the suitable means for mounting the implant component include a collet or a chuck, which is preferably formed with a receiving shape closely adapted to be the outside profile of the component, and which may be configured for vacuum clamping in a production setting. The means for mounting the implant component may be operated via manual or automated control. On a lathe, the implant component is mounted on the turning axis of the machine while on a fly cutter, it is mounted along the axis of the tool movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Once the implant component is mounted in accordance with the first step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the process continues to the second step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During the second step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the process, the component comes into rotational contact with a cutting tool or tools. The contacting of the cutting tool(s) and the component may be accomplished several ways, including, but not limited to, rotating the component and feeding the tool against the component or rotating the cutting tool(s) to fly cut a component which is held stationary or translated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The cutting tool(s) of the turning machine should be made of material(s), and should have a shape, a geometry and a sharpness, and should be rotated at a rate sufficient to achieve the aforesaid surface profile and surface finish for the component being cut. Generally, applicant has found a single diamond tool to suffice for the finish cut and for rough cuts if any of these are necessary. However, more cutting tools may be provided, and if more than one cutting tool is provided, these may include tools of high speed steel, carbide or the like for rough cutting. In any event, the final tool is a natural or synthetic diamond cutting tool. The diamond cutting tool may be brazed into a tool tip insert such as a steel or carbide insert. The cutting tool(s) should either be resharpenable or replaceable after a predetermined number of cuts or a predetermined amount of cutting time or when the tools(s) have achieved a predetermined level of dullness, and may be adapted to be easily retrofitted into existing turning machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The diamond cutting tools for use in the present invention have sharpness and radii of the cutting edge that allow removal of up to ten or twenty mils in a pass while minimizing the appearance of feed lines on the cut component. Each carbide cutting tool that is provided should have a sharp profile and a cutting radius. Moreover, the sharpness and radius of each of the cutting tools may differ from the other cutting tools, with the sharpnesses being effective to form one or more rough cuts to finish the component sufficiently to allow the diamond to cut the profile in a single pass. In practice, the rough and finish cuts may both be performed with the diamond tool. The cutting tool(s) or the component, whichever is being rotated, should be rotated at a rate over 1000 revolutions per minute, and is preferably rotated at 3500 revolutions per minute or more, with an effective cross feed rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The third step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the process is the cutting and shaping of the component by advancing the cutting tool(s) to form the desired surface profile. When the component is rotated, the cutting tool(s) are fed across a multi-axis, controlled feed path a predetermined number of times (with each time constituting one &ldquo;pass&rdquo;) in order to remove material from the surface of the component so as to achieve a final, predetermined surface profile on the component. Depending on such factors as the material from which the component is made and the geometry of the component, the amount of material removed may vary. Generally, for cutting a quasi-spherical surface, the feed path is an R, X &amp; Z feed path. The tool cross feed is slow, and the amount of time that elapses for cutting a quasi-spherical surface, or for the final cutting tool to complete its feed path, per pass, is about one minute, but may be set to be more or less time via numerical control. It should also be mentioned that manual or CNC-controlled R-0 type machines may also be employed. In this case, the tool may pivot in an arc to form the desired surface contour rather than interpolating the profile as a series of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a component with a surface finish that will significantly reduce or eliminate the formation of wear debris while not adversely affecting the microstructure of the component, the component is preferably cut so as to have a surface finish substantially free of tool marks visible to the unaided eye, for example, wherein the surface waviness of the component is under about 0.5 micrometers. The surface finish or roughness of the component should be substantially smoother than 0.5 micrometers, and is preferably a surface smoothness of approximately 0.05 to 0.10 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Such surface waviness and surface roughness characteristics may be attained by providing numerical control of the position of the cutting tool, and, if necessary, augmenting the total number of passes the cutting tool makes on the component. The numerical control is provided by computer in a way known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although a component may be cut by one or more carbide tools and a diamond cutting tool, or by only a diamond tool in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the diamond cutting tool should always be the last of the tools to contact the face of the component in order to provide the desired low surface roughness and waviness characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The third step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the process may also include vacuum and/or cooling systems, for example, to cool the cutting surface and/or to remove swarf that accumulates during the cutting process. These vacuum and cooling systems are adapted to perform in conjunction with the cutting tool(s) and the turning machine in ways generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, an implantable polymeric prosthetic joint or bone component is so as to have a two-dimensional surface contour with an as-machined surface profile in a cross direction with peak to valley surface smoothness effective to achieve in vivo particle generation at a residual level. That is, when placed in use, a moving component generates wear particles due to small irregularities of the opposing surfaces rubbing against each other. Typically, such particles are initially generated at a high rate, primarily from the irregularities of the polymeric components, and as the surfaces become more regular or better fitting, wear particles are generated at a lower or residual rate, which may approach a low or zero level. The present invention achieves this residual level with an as-machined surface of the polymeric component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 2A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, two exemplary implant components that may be prepared in accordance with the three-step process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are shown. The exemplary component <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference>A is an insert for a tibial tray and the exemplary component <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a liner for an acetabular component. Other implant components that may be prepared in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> include a joint or bone component such as a cup, shell, tray, stem, or head or any other implant component which has a face that, once implanted or during implantation, is a flat or curved surface which is to be subjected to contact or motion, including micro-motion such as that which occurs between nominally stationary, but contacting surfaces. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, implant components prepared in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an anterior surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a posterior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and also has medial and lateral surfaces or sides such as <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The implant has a superior face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of curved aspect that will be subjected to contact or motion when utilized in ways known in the art during, and subsequent to, the implantation of a hip prosthesis, and that face may be super finished in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> such that the face has a surface finish substantially free of tool mark waviness visible to the unaided eye wherein its surface waviness is under about 0.5 micrometers and its surface finish has a surface roughness substantially less than 0.5 micrometers, preferably less than approximately 0.05 to 0.10 micrometers. Similarly, an inferior surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be fly cut to a flat non-wavy super finished profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The liner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; is a concave shell of bearing material having an interior face <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; and an exterior surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As is generally known to those in the art, the liner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; fits within a generally metallic external support or acetabular component (not shown), while a ball of a corresponding femoral component of the prosthesis (not shown) bears against the interior surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; of the liner. The interior and exterior surfaces <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; of the liner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; will be subjected to contact or motion when utilized in ways known in the art during, and subsequent to, the implantation of a hip prosthesis, and these faces may be super finished in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> such that the faces have a surface finish substantially free of tool mark waviness visible to the unaided eye wherein its surface waviness is under about 0.5 micrometers and its surface finish has a surface roughness substantially less than 0.5 micrometers, preferably less than approximately 0.05 to 0.10 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> turning machine <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that functions in accordance with the present invention is shown. Specifically, this turning machine <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a horizontal, chucking-type, turret lathe adapted to be provided with a plurality of cutting tools. The lathe <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a tool feed carriage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a turning motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a component holding means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The component holding means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be provided as a chuck or a collet or any other suitable means known in the art to hold an implant component without deforming the component. Preferably it is a collet or chuck with a fitted recess sized for gripping and supporting the particular component. The tool feed carriage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further includes a turret-type tool holder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a tool feed compound <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for one or more cutting tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and is adapted to move along a z- or longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is parallel to the turning axis of the engine <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and also to move along a cross-feed direction. Any or all of the components of the turret lathe <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are adapted to be numerically controlled by computer (not shown). The turret lathe <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be adapted to include vacuum and/or cooling systems to remove swarf and heat generated by the cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> top view of the tool holding assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is shown. A four-way tool turret <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown having four cutting tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Generally all but one of the cutting tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are carbide tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A having sharpnesses, radii and rake angles appropriate for the material and shape being cut. However, the invention may be practiced using only the one diamond cutting tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B, or with a total number of cutting tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is greater or less than four while still being able to provide the requisite super finishing characteristics to implant components. The carbide tools, if provided, may be identical tools, with redundant ones serving as replacements to minimize set-up time when one becomes dull; or may be configured to make successively finer passes to reach the desired finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Super finishing characteristics are preferably achieved, through computerized numerical control, by cutting the component with one or a plurality of cutting tools <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such that the component has a circularly symmetric finish region on a surface of the component that is to be subjected to motion and/or sliding against another implant component. If the component is not sufficiently smooth or centered in its raw (e.g. cast, extruded or molded) state, it is first cut to a predetermined preliminary contour at which point a different one of the plurality of cutting tools may be moved to cut the surface of the component. Each cutting tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may have a different sharpness and radius. Moreover, a diamond cutting tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B should be the last cutting tool to be introduced to the surface of the component, wherein it removes material from the preliminary cut surface to form the final super finished machine cut surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One suitable turning machine as described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> is Precitech&apos;s Nanoform 200 model. The Nanoform 200 model is a two-axis, computer controlled, ultra-precision contouring machine which may be used with diamond cutting tools to form optical quality surfaces on a wide range of materials and which also may be equipped with a high-speed grinding attachment to form precision molds having high quality surfaces. The Nanoform 200 model is built on a granite base and utilizes a passive vibration isolation system. High stiffness hydrostatic oil bearing slideways are arranged in a &ldquo;T&rdquo; configuration such that the X-axis (spindle) slide represents the cross-arm of the &ldquo;T&rdquo; and the Z-axis (tool holding) slide represents the stem of the &ldquo;T.&rdquo; The Nanoform 200 model is available with a digital signal processor based control system which provides a one nanometer programming resolution, sub-count feedback signal interpolation and industry standard M and G code programming format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6</cross-reference>A, an exemplary diamond cutting tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for surface finishing of UHMWPE surfaces is shown. The tool has a shank length, L, of between about 70 millimeters to about 100 millimeters and an arc, A, of about 140&deg;. Moreover, the exemplary tool has a rake angle, &agr;, of about 50 to about 15&deg; and a front clearance angle, &bgr;, of about 30&deg;. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that these measurements may vary from tool to tool and/or may be greater or lesser than the above ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> graphical representation of surface waviness is shown. The graphical representation <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> notes the surface waviness, in micrometers, of prior art implant components and implant components as they relate to baseline variations of 0.5 and 0.05 micrometers. Prior art implant components have machine cut surface waviness measurements <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that are greater than about the 0.5 micrometer baseline which corresponds to surface texture that is visible to the unaided eye. These components may be polished to reduce roughness to below 0.4 micrometers, but they will retain this pattern of wavy cut lines. Implant components prepared in accordance with the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, however, have a surface waviness <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> substantially less than approximately 0.5 micrometers and preferably lying approximately between the 0.05 baseline and 0.1 micrometers, or below. It is the ability of the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to provide a smooth surface on implant components with a waviness of less than 0.5 micrometers that greatly reduces or eliminates the formation of wear debris during the &ldquo;breaking in&rdquo; or &ldquo;wearing-in&rdquo; of the components due to, among other things, micromotion and/or articulation and/or sliding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> schematic representation of surface contour is shown. The schematic representation <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shows a baseline <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that corresponds to an ideal flat or spherical surface contour of an implanted component. Curve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shows the actual profile and resulting machine ridges produced during a surface cutting and finishing process of the prior art. The prior art residual machine ridges <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> depart greatly from the ideal contour baseline <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> during one period <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the feed per rotation of the component/tool). Similarly large excursions may occur over even shorter intervals when the prior art cutting tool has waviness or wear irregularities. Conversely, small residual cut artifacts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are left by the super finishing cutting process of the present invention which depart from the ideal baseline <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by a very small amount. That amount of departure is substantially less than 0.5 micrometers, and is not visible to the unaided eye. Surface roughness is similarly very low, even without secondary polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will now become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments incorporating their concepts may be used. It is felt therefore that these embodiments should not be limited to disclosed embodiments but rather should be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</paragraph>

The mount plates <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are formed along the upper and lower surfaces of a mounting portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, in which an attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for attaching the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed, so as to hold the mounting portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>therebetween to reinforce the mounting portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the shape and dimension proportion of each element such as the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are shown by changing them from the actual ones for ease of understanding. A load portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a tapered shape of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has folded portions <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed by bending both edge portions of the load portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at right angles, by which the rigidity of the load portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is kept. A hinge portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, at which the folded portions are not formed, is formed with an opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to provide elasticity, and is bent at a predetermined bending angle &agr; with a bending portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>indicated by the indicating line A passing through the opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>being a boundary. This bend is caused by plastic deformation, so that this angle &agr; is kept in an unloaded state. However, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a state in which the hinge portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is not bent to simplify the explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The flexure <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is configured so that a bonding portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>indicated by the hatching in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is bonded and fixed to the lower surface of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and an arch-shaped notch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed in the range from an unfixed intermediate portion to a tip end portion. A flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed by the arch-shaped notch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed with a pivot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>projecting upward. At a stage at which the flexure <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is fixed to the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the tip end portion of the pivot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the lower part of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at one point, and other portions of the flexure <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> keep a state in which they are slightly separated from the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a pair of flexure arms <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, which are formed by the arch-shaped notch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are elongated in the lengthwise direction, act as springs at this time. Specifically, the flexure arms <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are curved slightly so that the tip end portion of the pivot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is pressed on the lower part of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in order to keep this state. Therefore, the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is slightly turnable in all directions around the contact point of the pivot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while having a restoring force. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is a top plan view of an essential part in the case where the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the rectangular parallelepiped slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are mounted to a bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to bond and fix these two elements to each other. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the essential part, in which a cross section including the reference line C passing through the centers of an alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an action pin <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> standing on an upper surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is viewed in the direction of the arrow mark X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is bonded to the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with a predetermined orientation is mounted on a slider mount <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The configuration is such that a fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> lies at the position indicated by the dotted line at this time not to hinder the work. At a stage at which the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has been mounted, the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is moved in the direction of the arrow mark X and presses the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with a predetermined urging force to hold the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and an opposite side wall portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is held at a slider mounting portion formed by the slider mount <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the side wall portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The configuration is such that the upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a tip end surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the slider project from each of adjacent parallel surfaces of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> through a predetermined width at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to which the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has not been bonded is mounted to the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is mounted so that the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is inserted in the alignment hole <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and the action pin <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is inserted in the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The configuration is such that a damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved to a position at which the mounting operation is not hindered by a not illustrated means at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the center distance w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the action pin <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> standing on the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is set so as to be substantially equal to the center distance between the alignment hole <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in a state in which the bend at the angle &agr; is stretched straight as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. Therefore, at a stage at which the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is mounted on the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is in a state of being stretched as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this state, the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and the mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pressed on and fixed to the upper surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> with a predetermined pressing force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the lower surface of the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>keep a state of being pressed on each other with a predetermined pressure. Therefore, an adhesive with low elasticity such as an epoxy adhesive is applied to either one bonding surface before these elements are joined, and this bonding state is kept during a subsequent predetermined drying process, by which these two elements can be bonded firmly or in a temporarily fixed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> After the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is bonded to the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as described above, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> pressing the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved again to the position indicated by the dotted line, and the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved from the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, that is, the state of pressing the mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the pressed state. At this time, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> tends to be restored to the state in which the bending angle &bgr; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) at the bending portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>becomes the aforementioned predetermined angle &agr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the engagement position of the alignment hole <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> fitting in the alignment hole <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> moves upward, and also the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> tends to be inclined in the direction of the arrow mark W with two contact portions being the support lines. The two contact portions are a contact portion at which the lower surface of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comes into contact with a comer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the slider mount <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a contact portion at which a lower surface comer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comes into contact with a slider mounting portion side wall <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> cannot move in the direction of the arrow mark Y due to the engagement of the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with the alignment hole <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Although the engagement position moves upward to some extent along with the deformation of the flexure arms <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, the inclination of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow mark W does not proceed due to the friction on the contact portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is caught by the bonding jig <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> during the separating process and a locked state is sometimes established. If an attempt is made to forcedly separate the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the bonding jig to release the HG assembly <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from this state, there arises a problem in that the flexure is deformed plastically or the bonding portion of the slider is peeled off. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next, the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved in the direction of the arrow mark YY, and the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with an arcuate portion of the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the bend of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is stretched. Thereby, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the centerline B of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> agrees with the reference line D of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously with or subsequently to this positioning work, the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved to the position shown in the figures of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to press a mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the upper surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a predetermined pressing force and fix the mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> onto the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For this purpose, the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> pressing the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved again to the position indicated by the dotted line, and further the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made in a free state, that is, a state of being movable freely in the direction of the arrow mark Y. In order to release the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> presses the mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved from that position. At this time, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> tends to be restored to a state in which the bending angle &bgr; at a bending portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>becomes the aforementioned predetermined angle &agr; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, along with the inclination of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves in the direction of the arrow mark Y while inclining with respect to the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also moves in the direction of the arrow mark Y while inclining with respect to the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such relative movement is allowed by the configuration in which the movement relative to the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is free because the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is an elongated hole, and a state in which the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> passes through the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with a play can be kept because the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can move freely. Therefore, the bending angle &bgr; at a hinge portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is restored to the aforementioned predetermined angle &agr; without being hindered, so that the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this restored natural state can be separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For both of these holes, by pulling a load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow mark YY, as in the case of the aforementioned elongated hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be positioned with respect to the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the bonding jig and the method for separating the HG assembly from the bonding jig in accordance with Embodiment 1, when the HG assembly is separated from the bonding jig, the stretched HG assembly can be restored to the original bent state without restriction.

However, the sectional view of the essential part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows a state in a process in which the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is separated from the boding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, this HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> differs from the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 1 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> in that a tab <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is provided at the tip end of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Other configuration of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is exactly the same as that of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the same reference numerals are applied to the same elements as those of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the duplicated explanation is omitted. Further, the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> differs from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 1 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that a tab support <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is additionally provided. Other configuration of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is exactly the same as that of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the same reference numerals are applied to the same elements as those of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and only the different portions are explained with emphasis thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the above-described configuration, the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is bonded to the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the same way as in the case of the above-described Embodiment 1, so that the detailed explanation thereof is omitted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a state in which after the aforementioned predetermined bonding process is finished, the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> presses the mount plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the upper surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the predetermined pressing force as shown in the figure to fix the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a state in which the flexure tongue <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thereof is bonded to the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the fixing lever <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> pressing the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved to the position indicated by the dotted line, and the damper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is moved from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> to leave the pressing state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At this time, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> tends to be restored to the state in which the bending angle &bgr; at a bending portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>becomes the aforementioned predetermined angle &agr; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Therefore, the engagement position of the elongated alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> fitting in the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> moves upward, and also the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> tends to be inclined in the direction of the arrow mark W with two contact portions being the support lines. The two contact portions are a contact portion at which the lower surface of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the comer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the slider mount <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a contact portion at which the lower surface comer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the slider mounting portion side wall <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Along with this inclination, the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moves in the direction of the arrow mark Y while inclining with respect to the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also moves in the direction of the arrow mark Y while inclining with respect to the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such relative movement is allowed by the configuration in which the movement relative to the alignment pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is free because the alignment hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is an elongated hole, and the state in which the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> passes through the attachment hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with a play can be kept because the movable pin <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can move freely. Along with the inclination of the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a tip end portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>of the tab <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>provided at the tip end of the load beam <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> comes into contact with an upper surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tab support <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After that, the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> inclines with this contact point being a fulcrum, so that the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> inclines in the direction of the arrow mark W and also moves in the direction of the arrow mark V. Therefore, a state in which the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is separated from the slider mount <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 3, when the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having the tab <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>at the tip end thereof is separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, not only the stretched HG assembly can be restored to the original bent state without restriction, but also a state in which the slider <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is separated from the slider mounting portion of the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is established. Therefore, as compared with Embodiment 1 in which the slider is in contact with the slider mounting portion at this time, the safety and work efficiency of the slider can further be increased when the HG assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is separated from the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The notch action pin <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is the action pin of the above-described Embodiment 2, has a shape of a combination of a prism and a pyramid. However, the shape of the action pin is not limited to this, and the action pin may be formed of a prismatic portion only or may have a shape of a combination of an elliptic column and an elliptic cone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, the bonding jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the above-described Embodiment 3 is configured so that the tab support <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is added to the bonding jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 1. However, the configuration is not limited to this, and may be such that the tab support <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is added to the bonding jig <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 2. Further, the upper surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tab support <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the above-described Embodiment 3 may be subjected to antislipping treatment or may be inclined to make the contacting tab less liable to slip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Still further, the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the above-described Embodiment 1 has a circular shape in cross section. However, the shape of the alignment pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not limited to this, and the cross section thereof may have an elliptic or semicircular shape to further increase the width of relative movement with respect to the alignment hole, or other various modifications can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also, terms &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo; have been used in the explanation of the above-described embodiments. However, these terms have been used for convenience only, and do not restrict the positional relationship in the state in which the bonding jig is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present invention has several advantages. According to the separating method defined in claim <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the bonding jig defined in claim <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, when the HG assembly is separated from the bonding jig, the stretched HG assembly is restored to the original bent state without restriction. Therefore, the HG assembly can be separated from the bonding jig without damage to the HG assembly. Also, according to the bonding jig defined in claim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, the same effect as that of the bonding jig defined in claim <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be achieved by merely making the shapes of the alignment pin and the action pin predetermined ones. Therefore, a bonding jig that has a simple configuration and is advantageous in terms of cost can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the bonding jig defined in claim <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, for the HG assembly having the tab <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the tip end thereof, not only the stretched HG assembly is restored to the original bent state without restriction, but also the slider can be separated from the slider mounting portion of the bonding jig. Therefore, the safety and work efficiency of the slider can further be increased compared with the bonding jig defined in claim <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the HG assembly is separated from the bonding jig. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for forming a thin film, particularly to a method for forming a thin film suitable for a secondary battery field usable for mobile electronic device and electric automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art Statement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> So far, a sol-gel method, a CVD method or a PVD method is employed as a thin film-forming method. These methods require a firing process after a molding process, a high vacuum condition, or a high energy condition accompanied with a substrate-heating process or a plasma-generating process. Therefore, those methods require large scale and complicate apparatus, resulting in large cost and complicate operationality in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above high energy condition runs counter to global environmental protection, resource saving and energy saving. Therefore, a new thin film-forming method without the above high energy condition has been desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a new thin film-forming method not including a high energy condition due to firing, heating or plasma generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for forming a thin film comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> setting a porous base material in between a pair of electrodes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> flowing a first reactive solution in between one electrode of the pair of electrodes and the base material, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> flowing a second reactive solution in between the other electrode of the pair of electrodes and the base material, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> applying a given voltage between the pair of electrodes, thereby to synthesize a compound thin film including the components of the first reactive solution and the second reactive solution on the porous base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The inventors related to the present invention have been intensely studied for developing a new thin film-forming method not including a high energy process. As a result, they have found out surprisingly that when a porous base material is set in between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode to which a given voltage is applied and a first reactive solution and a second reactive solution, which are different each other, are flown in between the cathode electrode and the base material and in between the anode electrode and the base material at their predetermined flow rates, respectively, a compound thin film including the components of the first reactive solution and the second reactive solution is directly synthesized on the base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conceptual view showing the state in which the compound thin film is synthesized directly on the porous base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this case, the first reactive solution is made of a water solution with a melted LiOH.H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O in a distilled water, and the second reactive solution is made of a water solution with a melted CoSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O in a distilled water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The first reactive solution is flown in between a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at its given flow rate, and the second reactive solution is flown in between an anode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at its given flow rate. When a given voltage is applied between the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the anode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the first and the second reactive solutions are dissociated, and thus, Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles exist in between the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles exist in between the anode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Then, these ion particles arrive at the porous base material, and the Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and the Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles pass through the surface interconnecting holes of the base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and arrive at the opposite surfaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A thereof, respectively. The Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles on the surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B react with a large amount of Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and oxide elements in the water solution to form a Co-based oxide thin film, made of LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or the like, on the surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B of the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles on the surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A react with a large amount of Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and oxide elements in the water solution to form a Co-based oxide thin film, made of LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or the like, on the surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A of the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, a compound oxide thin film such as the Co-based oxide thin film is directly synthesized and stabilized on the porous base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this case, if the difference in the flow rates and/or the pressures between the first and the second reactive solutions is controlled appropriately, the compound oxide thin film may be formed on either of the surfaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B or in the porous base material <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the thin film-forming method of the present invention, since the reactive solutions are flown constantly, the component particles such as the Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and the Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles to constitute the compound thin film always exist at their constant ratio. Therefore, the compound thin film can be formed uniformly, and a particulate compound or a powdery compound is not formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the thin film-forming method of the present invention, the crystalline compound thin film can be formed on the porous base material without a firing process after a thin film-forming process and a high energy condition including a substrate-heating process and a plasma generation </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention will be described in detail as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The flow rate of the first reactive solution in the thin film-forming method of the present invention is not restricted only if the compound thin film can be uniformly synthesized directly on the porous base material. Preferably, the flow rate of the first reactive solution is set within 0.001-100 mL/minute, particularly 0.1-10 mL/minute. Thereby, the compound thin film can be made uniformly irrespective of the kinds of the first reactive solution and the porous base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the flow rate of the second reactive solution is not restricted only if the compound thin film can be uniformly synthesized directly on the porous base material. However, preferably, the flow rate of the second reactive solution is set within 0.001-100 mL/minute, particularly 0.1-10 mL/minute on the basis of the above same reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The amplitude of the voltage to be applied between the pair of electrodes, the cathode electrode and the anode electrode, is not restricted only if the compound thin film can be uniformly synthesized directly on the porous base material as mentioned above. Preferably, the amplitude of the voltage is selected so that a current with a current density of 0.01-10 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is flown in between the pair of electrodes. In this case, reactive elements such as the Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and the Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles can be always produced at their optimum rates, and thus, the compound thin film can be always synthesized uniformly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the thin film-forming method of the present invention, an additional energy process such as a heating process is not always excluded. For example, it is desired to heat the first and the second reactive solutions to 60-300&deg; C., particularly 80-200&deg; C. In this case, the compound thin film can be uniformly synthesized on the porous base material effectively, and the crystallinity and the density of the compound thin film can be enhanced, irrespective of the kinds of the reactive solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Generally, a base material is heated to 500-800&deg; C. in a CVD method. Therefore, the above heating process of the thin film-forming method of the present invention is remarkably small in energy, compared with the above high energy process in the CVD method, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since not-reacted component elements remain in their respective reactive solutions, they can be easily retrieved, reproduced or circulated, so that environmental pollution can be repressed. On the other hand, since it is difficult to retrieve gaseous component elements because they diffuse in atmosphere immediately, the environmental pollution may occur to some degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The first reactive solution and the second reactive solution are selected on the kind of the compound thin film to be produced. The concentrations of the first and the second reactive solutions are determined on the thin film-forming rate and the physical properties of the compound thin film such as density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the pair of electrodes, the cathode electrode and the anode electrode, may be made of a well known electrode material such as carbon material, platinum material or cobalt material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The porous base material may be made of Teflon, paper or cloth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the case of forming an oxide thin film by the thin film-forming method of the present invention, it is desired to incorporate an oxidizer into at least one of the first reactive solution and the second reactive solution. Therefore, the reactive component elements such as the Co<highlight><superscript>3&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles and the Li<highlight><superscript>&plus; </superscript></highlight>ion particles can be easily reacted with oxygen elements, and thus, the oxide thin film can be easily formed uniformly and densely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this case, a well known oxidizer such as Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be used. Particularly, in the case of forming a Co-based oxide thin film as will be described below, Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is preferably used as the above oxidizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The thin film-forming method can be applied for any compound thin film, but may be preferably for the Co-based oxide thin film such as LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which is used as an electrode material of a lithium ion secondary battery, a V-based oxide thin film, a Mn-based oxide thin film, a Fe-based oxide thin film, a W-based oxide thin film and a Mo-based oxide thin film, which are employed as a fluorescent material and a luminescence material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This invention will be concretely described with reference to the following examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> First of all, 100 mL of a water solution composed of LiOH.H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O melted in distilled water was made as the first reactive solution. Then, a water solution composed of CoSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O melted in distilled water was made as the second reactive solution. Subsequently, 10 mL of 1 mol/L-Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>was added, as an oxidizer, to the second reactive solution so that the total amount the second reactive solution and the oxidizer is set to 100 mL. A pair of carbon electrodes were set in a flow-type reactor, and a porous base material made of Teflon was arranged in between the carbon electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first reactive solution was flown in between one carbon electrode and the porous base material at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/minute and the second reactive solution was flown in between the other carbon electrode and the porous base material at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/minute with applying a voltage of 5V between the carbon electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the first and the second reactive solutions were kept to 100&deg; C. In this case, a current density between the carbon electrodes was 0.2 A/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> 30 minutes later, the porous base material was taken out of the flow-type reactor, and washed and dried. Then, the surface of the porous base material was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The thus obtained X-ray diffraction pattern was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, diffraction peaks from LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Co(OH)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are observed on the surface of the porous base material. That is, it is turned out that a compound thin film made of LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>crystal, composed of Li element of the first reactive solution and Co element of the second reactive solution, is formed on the porous base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although this invention bas been described in detail with reference to the above examples, this invention is not limited to the above disclosure and every kind of variation and modification may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> For example, in the above example, the first reactive solution and the second reactive solution are made of the water solution in which only one substance such as LiOH.H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or CoSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O is melted in distilled water. However, the reactive solutions may be made of a water solution in which two or more substances are melted, depending on the composition of the compound thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a compound thin film can be directly synthesized on a porous material without a firing process in a conventional sol-gel method or a high energy condition including a high temperature substrate heating process or a plasma-generating process in a conventional CVD method or PVD method. As a result, a new thin film-forming method not including the high energy condition can be provided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These tires, which are described in French patent application FR 92/15061 and FR 93/14702, comprise not only the outer carcass but also a separate toroidal support ring of elastomer rubber, which is housed in an appropriate seat provided in the well of the wheel rim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the tire is removed from the wheel rim, said toroidal ring remains inside said outer carcass, hence to replace or repair the carcass said toroidal support ring has to be extracted and then reinserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To extract the ring from and then replace it into the outer carcass requires considerable force on the part of the operator, this force being mainly due to the rigidity of said elastomer ring and the rigidity of the carcass, and is also partly due to the uncomfortable position in which the operator is compelled to work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to solve the stated drawbacks within the framework of a rational and reliable solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention attains said object by providing a device which enables the toroidal ring to be extracted from the carcass, and then reinserted therein, automatically without the operator needing to apply any physical force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The device of the invention can be associated with a tire removal machine or be a separate accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Said device comprises a lower base provided on one side with means for supporting in the correct working position the tire outer carcass from or into which said toroidal ring is to be extracted or inserted, and provided on the opposite side with means for extracting or inserting said toroidal ring. Said means for supporting the tire outer carcass are adjustable in height to enable the tire to be positioned in the correct working position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Said means for extracting or inserting said toroidal ring comprise a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder-piston unit, with the rod of which there is associated at least one tool provided with at least one appendix for gripping the edge of said ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment said rod presents two appendices for gripping the edge of said ring, one provided to grip the edge of said ring only during its extraction from the tire outer carcass, and the other provided to grip said ring only during its insertion into the tire outer carcass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The special characteristics of the invention are stated in the claims.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Said figures show the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which comprises a base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of parallelepiped shape, provided to its right with the means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for supporting the tire P of SYSTEM PAX type produced by the MICHELIN Company, comprising the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the separate toroidal ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of elastomer rubber, located inside it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> On the opposite side of said base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> there is fixed a U-shaped support <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which supports means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for extracting or inserting said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> From the upper side of said base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> there upwardly projects an abutment element which in the illustrated example consists of an L-shaped tubular element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, against which the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the tire rests during the extraction and insertion of said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In greater detail, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, said support means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the tire P comprise two equal bars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, one end of which is hinged to the base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and presents a toothed portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The toothed portions <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the two bars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> mutually engage so that rotating one of the bars causes the other to rotate. The two bars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> support at their free end two cylindrical pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on which the tread of the tire P rests. To the bar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> there is also fixed a plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, to the free end of which there is fixed a catch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the locking element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of which can be inserted into a series of holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are aligned along a circumferential arc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the extraction or insertion of said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprise a pneumatic cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the casing <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of which is hinged to the rod <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by usual means, and which is free to rotate about its hinge point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the axis of said cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> lies in the plane passing through the center of said carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> of the cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> carries at its free end a profiled tool <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> comprising two appendices <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> which present a concave portion <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for gripping said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To the free end of the casing <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> there is fixed a fork-shaped member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> against which the top of said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rests during its extraction from the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P. Essentially, said member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> prevents the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from jamming between said rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and said casing <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the invention is operated via a switch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, by which the operator controls its operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Before describing the operation of the invention it should be noted that the edges <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P have different diameters at their beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show the various operating stages involved in extracting the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, the operator has firstly to place the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, carrying in its interior the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, on the pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, taking care to orientate the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that its larger diameter edge <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> faces the tubular element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The operator then adjusts the height of the pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, i.e. the orientation of the bars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, on the basis of the diameter of the tire P, so that the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P rests against the upper horizontal part of said tubular element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Having determined the correct height, the bars are locked in position by the catch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> At this point, while supporting the casing <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is operated to cause complete extraction of the rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> from the casing <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of the cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, so that the tool <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> passes through the central hole in the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The appendix <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is then positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> made to retract. By this means, the upper portion of the ring is extracted from the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by deforming as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. By continuing to retract the rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is brought into the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, i</cross-reference>.e. into a position substantially perpendicular to the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. From said position the operator can manually extract the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the carcass without exerting any force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> shown the operating stages involved in inserting the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For this purpose the operator has firstly to position the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, taking care to orientate it such that its smaller diameter edge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> faces the tubular element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Having rested the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the operator positions it at the correct working height by orientating the bars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and locks them in the correct position by means of the catch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the tire P rests against the upper horizontal part of said tubular element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The operator then inserts the lower end of the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into the central hole in the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with dashed lines, and then extracts the rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> of the cylinder-piston unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, so that the tool <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> passes through the hole in the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At his point the operator rotates the tool <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> through 180&deg;, and hooks the appendix <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> of the tool to the upper edge of said ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. By means of the switch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> he then retracts the rod <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, which as it retracts inserts the ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into to the carcass <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
